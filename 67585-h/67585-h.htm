<p class='c009'>The psychology of states of feelings, it is generally
recognised, is still in a confused and backward condition.
Although it has benefited in some measure
by the contemporary allurement of psychological
research, it must be acknowledged that it has only
exerted a moderate seduction upon workers; the
preference has been given to other studies, such as
those of perception, of memory, of images, of movement,
of attention. If any proof is necessary we
may find it in the bibliographies, now published in
Germany, America, and France, which give the
psychological inventory of each year; of the whole
number of books, memoirs, and articles which appear,
less than the twentieth part, on an average, relates
to the feelings and emotions. It is a very small
part compared to the part played by the emotions
and passions in human life, and this region of
psychology is not deserving of such neglect. It is
true that in recent years W. James and Lange seem
to have brought this state of stagnation to an end.
Their thesis, paradoxical in appearance, has aroused,
especially in America, many discussions, criticisms,
defences, and, what is of more value, observations
and researches.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>It must be acknowledged that for those who have
any care for precision and clearness the study of
the feelings and emotions presents great difficulties.
Internal observation, always an uncertain guide
which leads us but a little way, is here especially
questionable. Experiment has given some very
useful results, but they are much less important
and numerous than in other regions of psychology.
Detailed researches and monographs are lacking, so
that the subject abounds with questions on which
little light has yet been thrown. Finally, the
dominant prejudice which assimilates emotional
states to intellectual states, considering them as
analogous, or even treating the former as dependent
oh the latter, can only lead to error.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have, in fact, in every study of the psychology
of feeling to choose between two radically distinct
positions, and this choice involves a difference in
method. Concerning the final and essential nature
of states of feeling there are two contrary opinions.
According to one, they are secondary and derived,
the qualities, modes, or functions of knowledge; they
only exist through it; they are “confused intelligence”:
that is the <em>intellectualist</em> thesis. According
to the other, they are primitive, autonomous, not
reducible to intelligence, able to exist outside it and
without it; they have a totally different origin: that
is the thesis which under its present form may be
called <em>physiological</em>. These two doctrines exhibit
variations which I ignore, as I am not writing their
history, but they all come into one or the other of
these two great currents.</p>

<p class='c001'>The intellectualist theory, which is of considerable
age, has found its most complete expression in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>Herbart and his school, for whom every state of
feeling only exists through the reciprocal relation
of representations; every emotion results from the
co-existence in the mind of ideas which agree or
disagree; it is the immediate consciousness of the
momentary elevation or depression of psychic activity,
of a free or impeded state of tension. But it does not
exist by itself; it resembles musical harmonies and
dissonances, which differ from elementary sounds
though only existing through them. Suppress every
intellectual state, and feeling vanishes; it only
possesses a borrowed life, that of a parasite. The
influence of Herbart still persists in Germany, and,
with some exceptions (Horwicz, Schneider, etc.), complete
or mitigated intellectualism predominates.</p>

<p class='c001'>The doctrine which I have called physiological
(Bain, Spencer, Maudsley, James, Lange<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a>) connects all
states of feeling with biological conditions, and considers
them as the direct and immediate expression
of the vegetative life. It is the thesis which has been
adopted, without any restriction, in this work. From
this standpoint feelings and emotions are no longer a
superficial manifestation, a simple efflorescence; they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>plunge into the individual’s depths; they have their
roots in the needs and instincts, that is to say, in
movements. Consciousness only delivers up a part
of their secrets; it can never reveal them completely;
we must descend beneath it. No doubt it is awkward
to have to invoke an unconscious activity, to call in
the intervention of an obscure and ill-determined
factor; but to wish to reduce emotional states to
clear and definite ideas, or to imagine that by this
process we can fix them, is to misunderstand them
completely and to condemn ourselves beforehand to
failure.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the rest, this is neither the place to criticise
the intellectualist thesis, nor to justify the other
in passing; the whole work is devoted to this task.</p>

<p class='c001'>The book consists of two parts. The first studies
the more general manifestations of feeling: pleasure
and pain, the characteristic signs of this form of
psychic life, everywhere diffused under manifold
aspects; then the nature of emotion, a complex
state which in the order of feelings corresponds to
perception in the order of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second deals with the special emotions. This
detailed study is of great importance for reasons
which will be explained later on, especially because
we must not rest in generalities; it furnishes a means
of control and verification. The nature of the emotional
life cannot be understood unless we follow it
in its incessant transformations—that is to say, in
its history. To separate it from social, moral, and
religious institutions, from the æsthetic and intellectual
movements which translate it and incarnate
it, is to reduce it to a dead and empty abstraction.
Thus an attempt has been made to follow all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>emotions one after the other in the progress of their
development, noting the successive movements of
their evolution or their retrogression.</p>

<p class='c001'>The pathology of each emotion has been sketched
to complete and throw light on the study. I have
tried to show that beneath an appearance of confusion,
incoherence, and promiscuity, there is, from
the morbid to the normal, from the complex to the
simple, a conducting thread which will always bring
us back to the point of origin.</p>

<p class='c001'>A work which has for its aim to set forth the
present situation of the psychology of feeling and
emotion might have been made very long. By
eliminating every digression and all historical exposition,
it has been made as short as possible.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>INTRODUCTION. <br /> <br /> THE EVOLUTION OF THE AFFECTIVE LIFE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'><i>In all affective manifestations there are two elements: the
motor states or impulses, which are primary; the
agreeable or painful states, which are secondary—Unconscious
organic protoplasmic sensibility; microorganisms—Chemical
interpretation; psychological interpretation—Are
there pure states of feeling?—Affirmative
facts—The period of needs, the instinct
of conservation—The period of primitive emotions—How
they may be determined; the genetic or chronological
method—Fear, anger, affection, the self-feeling,
sexual emotion—Are joy and grief emotions?—The
abstract emotions and their conditions—The passions
are the equivalent in feeling of an intellectual obsession.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>At the outset it may be useful to sketch in rough outline
the general evolution of the life of feeling from its humble
origin in organic sensibility to its highest and most complex
forms. Afterwards we shall present the corresponding and
inverse picture, that of its dissolution.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we take at random, in the form in which daily experience
gives them to us, the states known under the vague
names of “sentiments,” “emotions,” “passions”: joy and
sorrow, a toothache, a pleasurable perfume, love or anger, fear
or ambition, æsthetic enjoyment or religious emotion, the
rage of gambling or benevolence, the shudder of the sublime
or the discomfort of disgust, and so on, for they are innumerable,
one first observation is obvious even on a superficial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>examination: all these states, whatever they may be,
offer a double aspect, objective or external, subjective
or internal.</p>

<p class='c017'>We note in the first place the <em>motor</em> manifestations:
movements, gestures, and attitude of the body, a modification
in the voice, blushing or pallor, tremors, changes in
the secretions or excretions, and other bodily phenomena,
varying in different cases. We may observe them in
ourselves, in our fellows, and in animals. Although they
may not always be motor in the strict sense, we may so
call them, since they are all the result of a centrifugal
action.</p>

<p class='c017'>We note also, in ourselves directly and by the evidence
of consciousness, in others indirectly and by induction, the
existence of certain states which are agreeable, painful, or
mixed, with their modes or shades, extremely variable in
quality and in intensity.</p>

<p class='c017'>Of these two groups—the motor manifestations on one
side, the pleasures, pains, and their compounds on the
other side—which is fundamental? Can we put them on
the same level, and if we cannot, which is that which
supports the other?</p>

<p class='c017'>My reply to this question is clear: it is the motor
manifestations which are essential. In other words, what
are called agreeable or painful states only constitute the
superficial part of the life of feeling, of which the deep
element consists in tendencies, appetites, needs, desires,
translated into movements. Most classical treatises (and
even some others) say that sensibility is the faculty of
experiencing pleasure and pain. I should say, using the
same terminology, that sensibility is the faculty of tending
or desiring, and <em>consequently</em> of experiencing pleasure and
pain. There is nothing mysterious in the tendency; it
is a movement or an arrest of movement in the nascent
stage. I employ this word “tendency” as synonymous
with needs, appetites, instincts, inclinations, desires; it
is the generic term of which the others are varieties; it has
the advantage over them of embracing at the same time
both the psychological and physiological aspects of the
phenomenon. All the tendencies suppose a motor innervation;
they translate the needs of the individual, whatever
they may be, physical or mental; the basis, the root of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the affective life is in them, not in the consciousness of
pleasure and pain which accompanies them according as
they are satisfied or opposed. These agreeable or painful
states are only signs and indications; and just as symptoms
reveal to us the existence of a disease, and not its essential
nature, which must be sought in the hidden lesions of the
tissues, organs, and functions, so pleasure and pain are only
<em>effects</em> which must guide us in the search and determination
of causes hidden in the region of the instincts. If the contrary
opinion has generally prevailed, and priority been
accorded to the study of agreeable and painful manifestations
considered as the essential element in the emotional
life and serving to define it, that is the result of a bad
method, of an exclusive faith in the evidence of consciousness,
of a common illusion which consists in believing
that the conscious portion of an event is its principal portion,
but especially the consequence of the radically false idea
that the bodily phenomena which accompany all states of
feeling are factors that are negligible and external, foreign
to psychology, and without interest for it.</p>

<p class='c017'>For the present what has just been said is only an affirmation;
the proofs will come later, and will occupy the whole
of this book; at the outset it is only necessary to indicate
clearly the position taken up. We may now follow the
evolution of the life of feeling in its chief stages, which
are—pre-conscious sensibility, the appearance of the primitive
emotions, their transformation either into complex and
abstract emotions or into that stable and chronic state which
constitutes the passions.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>I.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The first period is that of protoplasmic, vital, organic
pre-conscious sensibility. We know that the organism has
its memory; it preserves certain impressions, certain normal
or morbid modifications; it is capable of adaptation: this
point has been well established by Bering (who had been
preceded by Laycock and Jessen). It is the outline of the
superior form of psychic conscious memory. In the same
way there exists an inferior unconscious form—organic
sensibility—which is the preparation and the outline of
superior conscious emotional life. Vital sensibility is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>conscious feeling what organic memory is to memory in
the ordinary sense of the word.</p>

<p class='c017'>This vital sensibility is the capacity to receive stimuli and
to re-act to them. In a well-known memoir, now of ancient
date,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Claude Bernard wrote: “Philosophers generally only
know and admit conscious sensibility, that which their ego
bears witness to. It is for them the psychic modification,
pleasure or pain, determined by external modifications....
Physiologists necessarily place themselves at another point
of view. They have to study the phenomenon objectively,
under all the forms which it puts on. They observe that at
the moment when a modifying agent acts on man, it not
only provokes pleasure and pain, it not only affects the
soul: it affects the body, it determines other re-actions
besides the psychic re-actions, and these automatic re-actions,
far from being an accessory part of the phenomenon,
are on the contrary its essential element.” Then
he showed experimentally that the employment of anæsthetics,
pushed to an extreme, first abolished conscious
sensibility, then the unconscious sensibility of the intestines
and glands, then muscular irritability, finally the lively
movements of the epithelial tissue. In the same way
among plants: under the influence of ether the sensitive
plant loses its singular properties, seeds cease to germinate,
yeast to ferment, etc. Whence follows the conclusion that
sensibility resides, not in the organs or tissues, but in their
anatomical elements.</p>

<p class='c017'>Since then these investigations into protoplasmic sensibility
have been pursued with much ardour among micro-organisms.
These beings, sometimes animal, sometimes
vegetable, are simple masses of protoplasm, generally monocellular,
appearing homogeneous, without differentiation of
tissues. Now very varied <em>tendencies</em> have been found among
these organisms. Some seek light, others flee from it persistently.
The protoplasmic mass of myxomycetes which
live in the bark of the oak, if placed in a watch-glass
full of water, remain there in repose; but if sawdust is
placed around them they immediately emigrate towards it
as if seized by home-sickness. The actynophrys acts in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the same way with regard to starch. Bacteria can discover
even the trillionth part of a milligram of oxygen in a
neighbouring body. Certain sedentary ciliated creatures
appear to choose their food. Some also have thought that
they detected an elective tendency in the movement which
draws the male ovule towards the female ovule. I have only
recalled a few of the many facts which have been enumerated.</p>

<p class='c017'>If it is necessary to mention other examples, I may refer
to the case studied in our own days under the name of
“phagocytosis.” The struggle for life goes on, not only
among individuals, but also among the anatomical elements
which constitute the individual. Every tissue—muscular,
connective, adipose, etc.—possesses phagocytes (devouring
cells), of which the duty consists in devouring and destroying
old or enfeebled cells of the same kind. Besides these
special phagocytes there are general phagocytes, such as the
white corpuscles of the blood, which come to the help of
the others when they are not equal to their task. They
stand against the pathogenic microbes, waging upon them
an internal struggle, and opposing the invasion of infectious
germs. This apparently teleological property seems at first
very surprising. Later investigations have shown that the
phagocytes are endowed with a sensibility (called chemiotaxic),
owing to which they are able to distinguish the
chemical composition of their environment and to approach
it or leave it accordingly; deteriorated tissues attract certain
of them which incorporate the feeble or dead cells, while the
healthy and vigorous elements are perhaps able to defend
themselves by secreting some substance which preserves
them from phagocytosis.</p>

<p class='c017'>These facts, taken from among many others to which I
shall again have to refer when dealing with the sexual
instinct, have been interpreted in two very different ways:
one psychological, the other chemical.</p>

<p class='c017'>For some there is in all these phenomena a rudiment
of consciousness. Since the movements are adapted and
appropriate, varying according to circumstances, there must
be choice they say, and choice involves a psychic element;
the mobility is the revelation of an obscure “psyche”
endowed with attractive and repulsive tendencies.</p>

<p class='c017'>For the others (whose opinion I adopt), the whole may
be explained on physico-chemical grounds. No doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>there is affinity, attraction and repulsion, but only in the
scientific sense; these words are metaphors derived from
the language of consciousness which should be purged of
all anthropomorphic elements. Several authors have shown
by numerous observations and experiments the chemical
conditions which determine or prevent this pretended
choice (Sachs, Verworn, Löb, Maupas, Bastian, etc.).</p>

<p class='c017'>On this point, as on all questions of origin, we must
decide according to probabilities, and the probabilities
appear to be all in favour of the chemical hypothesis. In
any case, this matter has only a secondary interest for us
here. If we admit conscious tendencies, then the origin
of the emotional life coincides with the very origin of
physiological life. If we eliminate all psychology, there
still remains the physiological tendency, that is to say the
motor element, which in some degree, from the lowest
to the highest, is never quite wanting.</p>

<p class='c017'>This excursion into the pre-conscious period—since we
so regard it—puts us in possession of one result. At the
end of this investigation we find two well-defined tendencies,
physico-chemical and organic—the one of attraction, the
other of repulsion; these are the two poles of the life of
feeling. What is attraction in this sense? Simply assimilation;
it blends with nutrition. With sexual attraction,
however, we must note that we already reach a higher
grade; the phenomenon is more complex, the monocellular
being no longer acts to preserve itself but to maintain the
species. As to repulsion, we may remark that it is
manifested in two ways. On one side it is the opposite
of assimilation: the cell or the tissue rejects what does not
suit it. On another side, at a somewhat superior stage, it
is in some degree already defensive.</p>

<p class='c017'>We have thus gained a basis for our subject by finding
that beneath the conscious life of feeling there exists a
very low and obscure region, that of vital or organic sensibility,
which is an embryonic form of conscious sensibility
and supports it.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>II.</h3>

<p class='c019'>We now pass from darkness to light, from the vital to
the psychic. But before entering into the conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>period of the life of feeling and following it in the progress
of its evolution, this is perhaps the place to examine
a sufficiently important question which has usually been
wrongly answered in the negative: Are there <em>pure</em> states of
feeling—that is to say, states empty of any intellectual
element, of every representative content, not connected
either with perceptions or images or concepts, simply subjective,
agreeable, disagreeable, or mixed? If we reply in
the negative, it follows that without exception no kind
of feeling can ever exist by itself; it always requires a
support; it is never more than an accompaniment. This
proposition is held by the majority; it has naturally been
adopted by the intellectualists, and Lehmann has recently
maintained it in its most radical form; a state of emotional
consciousness is never met with; pleasure and pain are
always connected with intellectual states.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> If we reply in
the affirmative, then the state of feeling is considered as
having at least sometimes an independent existence of its
own and not as condemned to play for ever the part of
acolyte or parasite.</p>

<p class='c017'>This is a question of fact, and observation alone can
settle it. Although there are other reasons to give in
favour of the autonomous and even primordial character of
the life of feeling, I reserve them for the conclusion of this
book, to remain at present in the region of pure and simple
experience. There can be no doubt that, as a rule,
emotional states accompany intellectual states, but I deny
that it can never be otherwise, and that perceptions and
representations are the necessary condition of existence,
absolutely and without exception, of every manifestation of
feeling.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is a first class of facts which I only refer to in
order not to ignore them. Although they have been
invoked they seem to me to carry little weight. I refer
to the emotions which suddenly break out in animals and
are not explicable by any anterior experience. Gratiolet
having presented to a very young puppy a fragment of
wolf’s skin so worn that it resembled parchment, the animal
on smelling it was seized with extreme fright. Kröner, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>his book on cœnæsthesia,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> has collected similar facts. It is,
however, so difficult to know what passes in the consciousness
of an animal, and to ascertain the part of instinct and
of hereditary transmission, that I do not insist. Moreover,
in all these cases the emotion is excited by an <em>external</em>
sensation which touches a spring and sets the mechanism
of instinct at work; so that it might be argued that
we are not here concerned with a pure and independent
state of feeling. To remove all doubt, we require
cases in which the state of feeling precedes the intellectual
state, not being provoked by, but, on the contrary, provoking
it.</p>

<p class='c017'>The child at the beginning can only possess a purely
affective life. During the intra-uterine period he neither
hears nor sees nor touches; even after birth it is some
weeks before he learns to localise his sensations. His
psychic life, however rudimentary it may be, must consist
in a vague state of pleasure and pain analogous to ours.
He cannot connect them with perceptions, because he is
still unable to perceive. It is a widely accredited opinion
that the infant enters into life by pain; Preyer has questioned
this; we shall see later on what grounds. At present
we need not insist upon these facts, since we cannot interpret
them except by induction. Adults will furnish us with unquestionable
and abundant evidence.</p>

<p class='c017'>As a general rule, every deep change in the <em>internal</em>
sensations is translated in an equivalent fashion into the
cœnæsthesia and modifies the tone of feeling. Now the
internal sensations are not representative, and this factor,
of capital importance, has been forgotten by the intellectualists.
Of this purely organic state, which afterwards becomes
a state of feeling, and then an intellectual state, we shall
later on find numerous examples in studying the genesis of
the emotions; it is enough for the moment to note a few
of them. Under the influence of haschisch, says Moreau
(de Tours), who has studied it so well, “the feeling which
is experienced is one of happiness. I mean by this a state
which has nothing in common with purely sensual pleasure.
It is not the pleasure of the glutton or the drunkard, but is
much more comparable to the joy of the miser or that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>caused by good news.” I once knew well a man who for
ten years constantly took haschisch in large doses; he withstood
the drug better than might be expected, and finally
died insane. I received his oral and written confidences,
often to a greater extent than I desired. During this long
period I have often noted his feeling of inexhaustible satisfaction,
translated now and again into strange inventions or
commonplace reflections, but in his opinion invaluable. At
the epoch of puberty, when it follows its normal development,
we know that there is a profound metamorphosis.
Certain conditions, known or unknown, act on the organism
and modify its state (first moment); translated into consciousness,
these organic conditions give birth to a particular
tone of feeling (second moment); this state of feeling produces
corresponding representations (third moment). The
representative element appears in the last place. Similar
phenomena are produced under other conditions, in which
the cœnæsthesia is modified by the state of the sexual organs
(menstruation, pregnancy). The emotional state is produced
first, the intellectual state afterwards. But the most
abundant source from which we may draw examples at will
is certainly the period of incubation which precedes the
appearance of mental diseases. In most cases it is a state
of vague sadness. Sadness without a cause, it is commonly
said, and rightly, if by that is meant that it is produced
neither by an accident nor by bad news nor by ordinary
causes; but not causeless, if we take into consideration the
internal sensations which in such a case play a part which is
unperceived but not the less effective. This inclination to
melancholy is also the rule in the neuroses. Sometimes it
happens that the state of feeling, instead of being a slow
incubation, is an <em>aura</em> of emotional character and short
duration (a few minutes to at most a few hours). Some
patients, by repeated experience, are aware of this; they
know by the change that the attack is approaching. Féré
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Epilepsies</cite></span>) gives several examples; among others, that
of a young man who under these circumstances became
totally changed in character, which he expressed in an
original manner by saying, “I feel that my heart changes.”
That is because <em>in the last stage</em> this state of feeling takes
form and becomes fixed in an idea, as may best be seen in
persecutional insanity.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Without insisting, as would be easy, on any further
enumeration of facts, we may reduce these pure states of
feeling to four principal types:</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Agreeable state (pleasure, joy): that of haschisch and
similar drugs, certain stages of general paralysis of the insane,
the sense of well-being experienced by the consumptive and
the dying; many people who have escaped a death which
they considered certain have felt themselves overwhelmed
on its approach by a feeling of beatitude, without further
definition, which is perhaps only the absence of all
suffering.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>2. Painful state (sadness, annoyance): the incubation
period of most diseases, the melancholy of menstrual
periods.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. State of fear: without reason, without apparent causes,
without justification, without object; fear of everything and
of nothing: a fairly frequent state, which we shall examine in
detail when we come to the <em>phobias</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>4. State of excitability: connected with anger, frequent
in neurosis; it is an unstable and explosive state of being
which, at first vague and undetermined, ends by taking
form, attaching itself to a representation, and discharging
itself on an object.</p>

<p class='c017'>Finally, there are mixed states, formed by the co-existence
or alternation of simple states.</p>

<p class='c017'>From all which goes before it results that there is a pure
and autonomous life of feeling, independent of the intellectual
life and having its cause below, in the variations
of the cœnæsthesia, which is itself the resultant and concert
of vital actions. In the psychology of feeling the part
played by external sensations is very scanty compared to
that played by internal sensations, and certainly one must
be unable to see beyond the first to set up as a rule
“that there is no emotional state unconnected with an
intellectual state.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Having made this point clear, we may return to our
general picture of the evolution.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Above organic sensibility we find the stage of needs—that
is to say, of purely vital or physiological tendencies
with consciousness added. In man this period only exists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>at the beginning of life, and is translated by internal sensations
(hunger, thirst, need of sleep, fatigue, etc.). It is
constituted by a bundle of tendencies essentially physiological
in character, and these tendencies have nothing
added or external; they are life in action. Each anatomical
element, each tissue, each organ has but one end, to exercise
its activity; and the physiological individual is nothing but
the convergent expression of all these tendencies. They
may present themselves under a double form. In the one
case they express a lack, a deficiency; the anatomical
element, the tissue, the organism has need of something.
In this form the tendency is imperious and irresistible;
such is the hunger of the carnivorous animal, which
swallows its prey alive. In the other case they translate
an excess, a superfluity: such are, a gland which
needs to secrete, a well-nourished animal which needs
to move: this is the embryonic form of the luxurious
emotions.</p>

<p class='c017'>All these needs have a point of convergence—the
preservation of the individual; to use the current expression,
we see in them the exercise of the <em>instinct
of preservation</em>. On the subject of this instinct there have
recently been discussions which seem to me sufficiently idle.
Is the instinct of preservation primitive? is it derived?
Some authors are for the first hypothesis; others (especially
James and Sergi) lean towards the second. According to
the point of view each of these two solutions is admissible
and true. From the synthetic point of view the instinct of
preservation is primordial, since it is nothing else but the
resultant and sum of all the particular tendencies of each
essential organ; it is only a collective formula. From the
analytic point of view, it is secondary, since it presupposes
all the particular tendencies into which it is dissolved, since
each of its elements is simple, and since it adds nothing and
is nothing but their translation into consciousness. One
might ask in the same way if a sensation of sound is simple
or compound, and here also, according to the point of view,
the answer would vary. For consciousness the event is one,
simple and irreducible; for objective analysis the event is
compound, reducible to a definite number of vibrations.
In the various regions of psychology we might find many
problems of the same kind. The important point is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>understand that the instinct of preservation is not an entity,
but an abbreviated expression indicating a group of
tendencies.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Emerging from the period of needs, which are thus
reducible to tendencies of physiological order accompanied
by physical pleasures or pains, we now enter the period of
<em>primitive emotions</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>We cannot at the present point determine rigorously
and in detail what is meant by an emotion (see Part I.,
Chap. vii.); it is enough to give a rough but comprehensible
definition. From our standpoint, <em>emotion is in the order
of feeling the equivalent of perception in the intellectual
order</em>, a complex synthetic state essentially made up of
produced or arrested movements, of organic modifications
(in circulation, respiration, etc.), of an agreeable or painful
or mixed state of consciousness peculiar to each emotion.
It is a phenomenon of sudden appearance and limited
duration; it is always related to the preservation of the
individual or the species—directly as regards primitive
emotions, indirectly as regards derived emotions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Emotion then, even while we keep to its primitive forms,
introduces us into a higher region of the affective life in
which its manifestations become complex. But how can we
determine these primitive forms—the simple irreducible
emotions—for this is our principal aim? Many neglect
this determination, or leave it to arbitrary chance. The old
authors seem at this point to have followed a method of
abstraction and generalisation which could only lead them
to entities. It was an accredited doctrine among them that
all the “passions” can finally be reduced to love and hate;
we meet this thesis throughout. To reach this conclusion
they seem to have brought together and compared the
different passions, disengaged the resemblances, eliminated
the differences, and by continued reductions abstracted
from this multiplicity its most general characters.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>If by love and hate we are to understand the movements
of attraction or repulsion which lie at the bottom of the
emotions, there is nothing to be said; but we are only given
abstractions and theoretical concepts; such a determination
is illusory and without practical utility. If we understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>love (what love? for nothing is vaguer than this word) and
hate in a more concrete sense, and pretend to consider
them as the primitive source from which to derive all the
other emotions, that is a purely mental opinion, an assertion
which nothing justifies.</p>

<p class='c017'>The determination of the primitive emotions must be
made not by abstraction and generalisation, but by <em>verification</em>.
To attain this I can see but one method to follow—the
method of observation, which teaches us the order and
the date of appearance of the various emotions, and gives
us their genealogical and chronological list. We may count
as primitive all those which cannot be reduced to previous
manifestations, all those which appear as a new manifestation,
and those alone; all the others are secondary and
derived.</p>

<p class='c017'>The materials for this investigation can only be sought in
the psychology of animals and in that of children. The
first will give us but little help. No doubt special and
authoritative treatises enumerate the emotions of animals,
but without any distinction between the simple and the
compound, and with no precise indication as to the order
of their appearance. It is not the same with infantile
psychology; the numerous studies published on this subject
during the last thirty years have rendered possible an
attempt which could not be made before.</p>

<p class='c017'>The question is then to determine in accordance with
facts the order in which the emotions appear, only taking
into account those which seem primitive—that is to say,
not reducible to other emotions. I limit myself to their
simple enumeration, with an indication of their chief characters;
each of them will be the object of a special study
in the second part of this book.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Fear is the first in date, according to unanimous
observations. Preyer finds that it is manifested from the
second day. At the same time the fact which he records
seems to me to agree with surprise rather than with fear
properly so called. In any case, according to the same
author, it is easy to note it after twenty-four hours. Darwin
thought he could only observe it at the end of four months,
Perez at two months. The last is inclined to believe that
this emotion is first aroused by auditory sensations, and
then by visual sensations. The precocity of its appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>has been attributed to hereditary transmission, an assertion
which we shall have to examine.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. After the defensive emotion, the offensive emotion
appears in the form of anger. Perez notes it between two
and three months; Preyer and Darwin at ten months; they
mean real anger, marked by the contraction of the eyebrows
and other clear symptoms (to throw itself about, crying,
etc.). Naturally the dates indicated for each emotion are
not rigorously fixed; they must vary according to the child’s
temperament and circumstances.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. Then comes affection. Some authors use the word
sympathy, which seems to me too vague. It shows itself
by its fundamental method of expression, the movement of
attraction, the seeking for contact. Darwin, who has well
described it, remarks that it probably appears very early in
life, judging by the infant’s smile, in the second month, but
that he had no clear proof that the child recognised any
one before the fourth month; at the fifth month he showed
a wish to go towards his nurse, but only at twelve months
did he show affection spontaneously and by plain gestures.
Darwin adds that sympathy (?) was manifested exactly at
ten months, eleven days, when the child’s nurse pretended
to cry.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> According to Perez, it appears towards ten months.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
It is from this source that complex forms of great importance
must later on be derived—the social and moral
emotions.</p>

<p class='c017'>With fear, anger, and affection we remain in the region of
the emotions which man shares with animals; for even
affection is met with very low in the animal series, at all
events in the form of maternal love. These three emotions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>have therefore a very clear character of universality. We
now make a step which introduces us into a purely human
region.</p>

<p class='c017'>4. This stage is marked by the appearance of emotions
connected with the personality, the ego. Hitherto we have
had an individual, a living being with more or less vague
consciousness of his life; but the child, usually towards the
age of at least three years, becomes conscious of himself as
a person. Then appear new emotional manifestations, of
which the source may be called for lack of a better term the
self-feeling or egoistic emotion (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>selbstgefühl</i></span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>amour propre</i></span>),
and which may translate itself in two forms: in a negative
form as a feeling of powerlessness and debility, and in a
positive form as a feeling of strength and audacity. This
feeling of plenitude and exuberance is the source from
which later numerous emotional forms are derived (pride,
vanity, ambition). Perhaps also we must connect with it
all those which express a superfluity of life: the need of
physical exercise, play in all its forms, curiosity or the desire
for knowledge, the need of creation by imagination or
action.</p>

<p class='c017'>5. There remains the sexual emotion; it is the last in
chronological order and the moment of its appearance is
easy to fix, since it has objective physiological marks. It is
an error to suppose that it can be derived from affection, or
that affection can be derived from it, as has sometimes been
maintained. The observation of facts completely condemns
this thesis, and shows that they cannot be reduced one to
the other. Later on we shall meet with evident proofs.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now we meet with one of those embarrassing questions
with which our subject is full. Must we here conclude our
list of primitive emotions, or must we add two others: joy
and grief? It is possible to incline to the latter view. Thus
Lange has included joy and grief among the four or five
simple “emotions” which he has chosen as types of his
descriptions. The following reasons, in my opinion, are
against this solution. No doubt joy and grief present all
the characters which constitute an emotion: movements
or arrest of movements, changes in the organic life, and a
state of consciousness <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sui generis</i></span>. But in that case physical
pleasure and physical pain must also be included among
the emotions, for they both present the characters above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>enumerated; moreover, there is an identity of nature
between physical pleasure and joy on one side, physical pain
and grief on the other side, as I hope to prove later on;
the only difference is that the physical form is preceded by
a state of the organism, the moral form (joy, grief) by a
representation. In other words, we should have to class
pleasure and pain (without qualification or restriction)
among the primitive emotions. Now these two alleged
emotions present, with reference to the five already named,
an evident and capital difference: their character of generality.
Fear is quite distinct from anger, affection from self-feeling,
and sexual emotion from the other four by its
specific mark. Each of them is a complex state, distinct
and impenetrable; just as vision is in relation to hearing,
or touch to smell. Each expresses a particular tendency
(defensive, offensive, attraction to the like, etc.), and is
adapted to a particular end. Pleasure and pain, on the
contrary, express general conditions of being; they are
diffused everywhere and penetrate everywhere. There is
pain in fear, in certain moments of anger and of the self-feeling;
there is pleasure in sexual emotion, in certain
moments of anger and of the self-feeling. These two states
have no domain of their own. Emotion, by its nature,
particularises; pleasure and pain by their nature universalise;
they are the general marks of the affective life, and if they
coincide like the emotions with motor, vaso-motor, and other
phenomena, that is because no form of feeling can exist
without its physiological conditions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such are the reasons for which I refuse to class the agreeable
and painful states among primitive emotions, and to
consider them as of the same nature. As to the moment
of their appearance, physical pain is held to co-exist with
the very beginning of extra-uterine life; physical pleasure
resulting from satisfied appetite, the sensation of warmth,
etc., must begin almost at the same period. Joy and grief are
later. According to Preyer, the smile and brightness of the
eyes indicate joy; “from the second month an infant takes
pleasure in hearing singing and the piano.” I am not
sure that this example is very decisive; I prefer to see here
the pleasure that is mostly physical. Darwin observed it
towards the fourth month, perhaps before, but very clearly
towards twelve months on the return of an absent person.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Grief may manifest itself, according to Preyer, towards the
fourth month (tears before the fourth week). Darwin, in the
observation already quoted, makes the first appearance at
six months. On the whole, the observations are few and
wanting in harmony, because of the great difficulty at this
moment of life in distinguishing with certainty between the
two forms of pleasure and the two forms of pain.</p>

<p class='c017'>At the root of each of the primitive emotions there is a
tendency, an instinct; but I do not claim that this list
exhausts the human instincts; later on we shall have to
return to this point (Part II., Introduction). Let us admit
as a provisional hypothesis that these five emotions alone
are irreducible, and all the others derived from them.
In the sequel I shall try to indicate how these secondary
emotions are the result of a complete evolution, of an
arrest of development, or of a mixture and combination
(Part II., Chapter vii.).</p>

<h3 class='c018'>III.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Above these emotions, which, though composed of several
elements, are simple as emotions, and may be called innate
since they are furnished by the organism itself, there are
numerous forms of feeling manifested in the course of life,
aroused by representations of the past or the future, by the
construction of images, by concepts, by an ideal. As each
primitive emotion will be studied in its total development,
from its lower to its most highly intellectualised forms, it is
useless now to attempt a sketch of this ascending march,
which, when reduced to generalities, would be vague and
confused. It reaches its last stage in the loftiest regions of
science, art, religion, and morals.</p>

<p class='c017'>One may assert without risk that these higher forms are
unattainable by the great majority of men. Perhaps scarcely
one person in a hundred thousand or a million reaches them;
the others know them not, or only suspect them approximately
and by hearsay. They are a promised land only
entered by a few of the elect.</p>

<p class='c017'>To reach the higher sentiments, in fact, two conditions are
needed: (1) one must be capable of conceiving and understanding
general ideas; (2) these ideas must not remain
simple intellectual forms, but must be able to arouse certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>feelings, certain approximate tendencies. If one or other
condition is wanting, the emotion is not produced.</p>

<p class='c017'>The formula of the evolution during this period is very
simple; the order of development of the emotions depends
strictly on the order of development of general ideas;
it is the evolution of ideas which rules that of feelings.
Here we are in perfect agreement with the intellectualist
theory.</p>

<p class='c017'>The faculty of abstraction and generalisation is very
unequally apportioned. It depends on the race, the age,
the individual. Some never pass the level of generic images
which are only concrete images simplified and condensed.
Some reach those medium forms of abstraction in which the
word plays the part of substitute for the reality, but requires,
in order to be understood, that the qualities of the thing which
it represents should be figured by a vague scheme, the concomitant
of the word. Some reach the stage of complete
substitution, in which the word takes the place of the whole,
and has need of no auxiliary to insure the mental operation.
Each of these degrees (which include sub-divisions I do not
indicate) has its possible echo in feeling. Thus every one,
according to the range of his intelligence, may reach some
or all these stages, and according to his temperament
experience or not experience at each of them an emotional
state. The emotions which are susceptible of a complete
evolution will furnish the proofs. A very simple example
may be found in the sexual impulse, which may in turn be
physiological, psycho-physiological, chiefly psychological,
and finally intellectual. At its lowest stage (in the micro-organisms
and similar beings) we find facts of a purely vital
and organic order, in my opinion unconscious; then consciousness
appears, but the sexual emotion manifests itself
in a purely specific shape without individual choice; it
is simply an instinct, “the genius of the race making
use of the individual to reach its own ends.” Later
on individuality becomes marked; we find choice;
the tender emotions, not found in the early stage, are
superadded. Then comes the moment of equilibrium
between the organic elements and the psychic elements, as
usually found in the normal average man. This state is
very complex, resulting from the fusion or convergence of
numerous tendencies, hence its power of attraction. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>comes a rupture of equilibrium, a period of interversion;
the physiological element is slowly effaced, the psychic
element gains in intensity; it is a repetition of the
primitive period, but in the opposite direction. This is
the intellectual phase of love; the idea appears first, the
physiological phenomena come afterwards. At a more
elevated stage of refinement the concrete personal image
is replaced by a vague impersonal representation, an ideal,
a concept; this is pure platonic mystical love, the organic
accompaniment of which is so feeble that it is usually
denied.</p>

<p class='c017'>These subtle and refined forms which the intellectualists
regard as superior are really only an impoverishment of
feeling. They are besides rare, and except in a few cases
ineffective; for it is a rule that every feeling loses its strength
in the measure that it becomes intellectualised. The blind
faith in “the power of ideas” is in practice an inexhaustible
source of illusions and errors. An idea which is only an
idea, a simple fact of knowledge, produces nothing and does
nothing; it only acts if it is <em>felt</em>, if it is accompanied by an
affective state, if it awakes tendencies, that is to say, motor
elements. One may have thoroughly studied Kant’s
<cite>Practical Reason</cite>, have penetrated all its depths, covered it
with glosses and luminous commentaries, without adding
one iota to one’s practical morality; that comes from another
source, and it is one of the most unfortunate results of
intellectualist influence in the psychology of the feelings
that it has led us to ignore so evident a truth.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c019'>It may be remarked that in contemporary treatises the
word <em>passion</em> has almost entirely disappeared, or is only met
with incidentally.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Yet it has a long past which would be
interesting to trace, if I had not forbidden myself all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>historical digressions. At present the term emotion is
preferred to designate the chief manifestations of the
affective life; it is a generic expression; passion is only a
mode of it. Ordinary language rightly preserves the word,
since it answers to a reality; and passion is an event of too
much practical importance for us to dispense with speaking
of it, explaining how it differs from emotion, what its nature
is, and under what conditions it appears.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is a fairly general agreement as to its definition;
and beneath different formulas, according as they emanate
from a moralist, a theologian, a philosopher, or a biologist,
we always find the same essential characters: “it is an
intemperate want;” “it is an inclination or liking carried to
excess;” <a id='corr20.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='it'>“it</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_20.14'><ins class='correction' title='it'>“it</ins></a></span> is a violent and sustained desire which dominates
the whole cerebral being,” etc.; the terminology alone
varies.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>If we seek the special mark of passion and its characteristics
among the phenomena of the affective life, we must
distinguish it from emotion on one side and insanity on the
other; for it is situated midway between the two.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is difficult to express with clearness and precision the
difference between emotion and passion. Is it a difference
of nature? No, for emotion is the source whence passion
flows. Is it a difference of degree? This distinction is
precarious, for while there are calm emotions and violent
passions, the contrary may also be met with. A third
difference remains, duration. It is generally said that
passion is an enduring state; emotion is the acute form,
passion the chronic form. Violence and duration are the
characters usually assigned to it; but we may further
define its essential nature. <em>Passion is in the affective order
what an imperative idea (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">idée fixe</span>) is in the intellectual order</em>;
we might add what a contraction is in the motor order.
It is the affective equivalent of the imperative idea. This
needs some explanation.</p>

<p class='c017'>The normal intellectual state is a plurality of states of
consciousness determined by the mechanism of association.
If at a given moment a perception or representation arises
and occupies alone the chief field of consciousness, ruling
as a sovereign, making a space around it, and only permitting
associations which are in direct relation with itself, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>have a state of attention. This “monoideïsm” is by its
nature exceptional and transitory. If it does not change its
object, persisting or repeating itself constantly, we have the
fixed idea, which may be called permanent attention. It is
not necessarily morbid, as Newton’s celebrated phrase and
other evidence show; but the latent or actual sovereignty of
the fixed idea is absolute and tyrannical.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the same way the normal state of feeling is the succession
of pleasures, troubles, desires, whims, etc., which in
their temperate form, and often dulled by repetition, constitute
the prosaic round of ordinary life. At a given
moment some circumstance causes a shock; that is emotion.
Some tendency annihilates all the others, momentarily confiscating
the whole activity to its profit; that is the equivalent
of attention. Usually this passage of movements in a single
direction is not enduring; but if, instead of disappearing,
the emotion remains fixed, or repeats itself incessantly,
always the same, with the slight modifications involved in
passing from the acute to the chronic stage—that is passion,
which is permanent emotion. In spite of apparent eclipses,
it is always ready to appear, absolute and tyrannical.</p>

<p class='c017'>Concerning the origin of passion, moralists and novelists
have remarked that it comes into being in two different ways—by
a thunderbolt or by “crystallisation,” by sudden action
or by slow actions. This double origin denotes predominance
either of the affective life or of the intellectual life. When
passion is born suddenly it issues directly from emotion
itself and retains a certain violence of nature, so much at
least as its metamorphosis into a permanent disposition
admits. In the other case the initiative is taken by the
intellectual states (images, ideas), and the passion is slowly
constituted as the result of association which itself is only
an <em>effect</em>, for it obeys a latent influence, a hidden factor, an
unconscious activity only revealed by its work. Representations
only attract each other and associate by reason of their
affective similitude, of the emotional tone which is common
to them, and by successive additions these little streams
form a river. This form of passion, on account of its
origin, has less ardour and more tenacity.</p>

<p class='c017'>After distinguishing passion from emotion, it is still
necessary to separate it from insanity, its other neighbour.
Certain authors have at once classed all passions with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>insanity; I cannot accept this proposition. It may suit
the moralist, by no means the psychologist. But the task
of separation is very delicate, and cannot be attempted in
this Introduction. The distinction between the normal and
the morbid, always difficult, is especially so in the case of
the psychology of the feelings. I shall endeavour elsewhere
(Part I., Chap. iv.) to find the indications which enable us
to establish this separation legitimately, and the task which
we now put aside in its general form will come before us
later on in the case of each particular emotion.</p>

  <h3 id='ch1.1' class='c005'>CHAPTER I. <br /> <br />PHYSICAL PAIN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Its anatomical and physiological conditions; pain nerves,

<p class='c016'>Many definitions of pain have, very unnecessarily, been
offered. Some are even tautological, others imply a
hypothesis as to its nature by relating it to strong stimulations.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
Let us regard it as an internal state which
every one knows by experience, and of which consciousness
reveals innumerable modes, but which by its generality
and its multiplicity of aspect escapes definition.</p>

<p class='c017'>In its primitive form pain is always physical, that is to say,
connected with external or internal sensations. Sufficiently
precise as regards superficial parts of the body, especially
the skin, its localisation is vaguer when it is seated in the
deeper parts, the viscera, the instruments of organic life.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>In the last case, when the pain is of internal and non-peripheral
origin, coming from the great sympathetic or the
related vagus nerve, it is accompanied by a state of anxiety,
of depression, or of anguish, which we shall often encounter,
and which frequently causes it to be said that “it seems to
the patient that the workings of nature within him are suspended.”
For the present, without distinguishing between
these two origins, external and internal, we will study the
<em>objective</em> characters of physical pain taken in general:
first its anatomical and physiological conditions, then the
bodily modifications which accompany it and in popular
language are called its effects.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>

<p class='c019'>The transmission of painful impressions from the periphery
to the cortical centres is far from being determined in all the
stages of its course.</p>

<p class='c017'>The nerve terminations, from their outpost position,
receive the first shock; but what part do they play? It
is known that the nerves of the deep organs and the
filaments of the great sympathetic have no specially constructed
terminations. The nerves of special sense, on the
contrary,—vision, hearing, smell, and taste,—possess special
peripheral apparatus (retina, organ of Corti, etc.) of very
complex anatomy; it is known that their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> is specially
sensorial; they are above all instruments of knowledge,
seldom directly of pain or pleasure. So that the question of
nerve terminations in relation to pain may chiefly be confined
to the nerves of the tactile apparatus, taking the
word in its largest sense. The extreme difficulty of isolating
the purely peripheral impression from that which reaches
the nerve itself renders almost insoluble the question as to
the part played by these peripheral apparatus. Beaunis,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
relying on the cases of localised anæsthesia in which the
patient no longer feels pain but still perceives contact,
thinks that analgesia would reach the nerves before acting
on their terminations, shut up in more or less resistant
capsules.</p>

<p class='c017'>Are there special nerves for the transmission of pain?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Goldscheider, well known for his researches on cold and
heat points on the skin, at first maintained that there are.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
According to him, the pain-bearing nerve filaments are
interlaced with the sensorial nerves, more numerously with
the nerves of general sensation (touch, heat, cold), less
numerously with those of special sense. If the existence of
these special pain nerves were well established, it would
have as great an importance for our subject as the discoveries
of Sachs and others, on the nervous filaments
peculiar to the muscles, have had for the study of the
kinæsthetic sense. But this physiologist has since repudiated
his first assertion, and maintained that it was misunderstood;
he admits pain points (points sensible to pain),
but not a specific organ for pain nor special nerves to
transmit it.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Frey, on the other hand, professes to have
proved experimentally both pain nerves and appropriate
terminal organs. His observations have been rejected as
inaccurate. At the present time there is nothing to establish
the existence of pain nerves, and most authors have given
strong reasons against the probability of such a discovery.
Rejecting this hypothesis, we may admit that an impression
of pain, like any other impression, is transmitted by the
nerves of general or special sensibility. When it has entered
the spinal cord at the posterior roots, the road it follows to
reach the higher centres has given rise to much investigation
and discussion. According to Schiff, transmission takes
place through the grey substance, tactile impressions passing
by the posterior fibres; there would thus be two distinct
paths, one for the feeling, the other for the sensation properly
so-called. Brown-Séquard also admits distinct paths, but
through the grey substance alone; the anterior region is
devoted to touch, the median to temperature, the posterior
to pain. According to Wundt, impressions of touch and
temperature have a primary path through the white substance
when stimulation is moderate, a secondary path
through the grey substance acting as a surplus channel when
stimulation is violent. The hypothesis of separate paths,
whatever they may be, has the advantage of harmonising
with the well-known fact, to which we shall return, that the
transmission of pain is slower than sensorial transmission.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Lehmann, who takes up a rigidly intellectualist position,
cannot admit that the element of feeling has a certain independence
in relation to the element of sensation, existing
by itself. He believes that the delay is explained by the
fact that “pain requires a stronger excitation in the sensorial
region than sensation without pain, and that consequently
pain is only produced after sensation, as the excitation
increases in intensity.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a> This explanation may be accepted,
but it assumes that pain always depends on intensity of
stimulus, which is not proved.</p>

<p class='c017'>From the spinal cord we reach the medulla, to which
some authors assign the chief part. The latest, Sergi, in
his book <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Dolore e Piacere</cite></span> (Milan, 1894), makes it the seat
of the affective phenomena in general (pains, pleasures,
emotions). What in his opinion testifies to the importance
of the medulla in the affective life is the number and nature
of the nervous centres situated between the protuberance
and the floor of the small ventricle, centres which act on
the heart, the vessels, the lungs, the secretions, the intestinal
movements. “The vital knot of Flourens is the vital centre
and must also be the centre of pleasure and pain, which are
merely alterations in the functions of organic life.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a> In his
opinion (which is mine also) the part played by the brain in
the genesis of states of feeling has been exaggerated; it only
acts in two ways—by rendering the disturbances of organic
life, the physical basis of the feelings, apparent to consciousness,
and as a cause of stimulation by means of ideas.</p>

<p class='c017'>However disposed we may be to restrict the part played
by the brain—that is to say the cortical layer—it remains a
predominant factor and the final terminus in the process of
transmission. Here we plunge into darkness. Researches
into cerebral localisation teach us on this subject nothing
which is generally admitted. During the first period of such
studies, which may be called that of circumscribed localisation
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à outrance</i></span>, Ferrier placed the seat of the emotions in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the occipital lobes, because, in his opinion, that region of
the cortex receives the visceral sensations, because the sexual
instinct is dependent upon them, and finally, because these
lobes are more developed in women than in men. It is
needless to bring forward the numerous criticisms of this
thesis. During the second and present period of localisation,
which may be called that of disseminated localisation,
functional rather than anatomical, authors are little inclined
to admit a particular centre for the affective life in general,
and still less for pain. All the sensory centres, and even all
the motor centres (perhaps there are fundamentally only
sensori-motor centres with preponderance of one or the
other element), may under certain conditions of activity
produce in consciousness a feeling of pleasure or pain.</p>

<p class='c017'>The hypothesis of a cortical centre is not, therefore, probable;
I shall return to this point in discussing the emotions.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>

<p class='c019'>The modifications of the organism which accompany
physical pain have been so often described that it is enough
to trace a slight outline of them. They may be reduced to
a single formula: pain is associated with diminution and
disorganisation of the vital functions.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. It acts on the movements of the heart, generally
decreasing its frequency; in extreme cases the slackening
may go so far as to produce syncope. In animals submitted
for experiment in the laboratory, even after removal of the
encephalon, painful impressions diminish the cardiac contractions.
In man, though the frequency of the pulse is
sometimes increased in one form or another, there is always
a modification of the rhythm appreciable by the sphygmograph.
Bichat was right when he said: “If you wish to
know whether pain is real, examine the pulse.”</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The influence on respiration is more irregular and
more unstable; the rhythm becomes abnormal, sometimes
rapid, sometimes slow; the inspirations are successively
short and deep. But the final result is a notable diminution
in the carbonic acid exhaled—that is to say a real slackening
of combustion. The temperature is lowered. “I had
imagined,” says Mantegazza, “that pain would be accompanied
by an increase of heat, muscular action being very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>intense under the influence of great suffering. Experiment
on animals and on myself proved the contrary.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Heidenhain
and Mantegazza have in fact noted an average diminution
of two degrees centigrade, which, according to the
latter, may last an hour and a half or more; it would be
due to the contraction of the peripheral blood-vessels.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The action of pain on digestion is well known, and
shows itself by retardation or disturbance: loss of appetite,
arrest of secretions, indigestion, vomiting, diarrhœa, etc.
If permanent it acts on the general nutrition, and shows
itself in modifications of the urinary secretion, and lasting
discoloration of the skin or hair. It is not infrequent to
find blanching of the hair, the beard or eyebrows in a few
days under the influence of great pain.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>4. The motor functions translate pain in two opposite
ways: the passive form of depression, arrest, or total suppression
of movements, in which the patient seems overcome;
the active form, marked by agitation, contortions, convulsions,
and cries. The latter case seems to contradict the general
formula connecting pain with diminished activity, and seems
to me to have been misinterpreted by some authors. This
violent excitement, indeed, is an expenditure which quickly
makes itself felt and soon leaves the individual enfeebled.
It does not flow, as in joy or play, from a surplus of activity;
it is weakening, irregular and spasmodic. It seems to me
to originate in the instinctive expression of the emotions.
The wounded animal shakes the painful part of his body,
his paw or his head, as if trying to expel the suffering. All
these disorderly and violent motor reactions are a defence
of the organism, a useless and often hurtful defence, but
resulting from acts which, formerly or under other circumstances,
were adapted to their end.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lehmann experimented on five persons, submitting them in
turn to agreeable and disagreeable impressions, in both cases
registering the changes in respiration and in the volume
of the arm with the help of Mosso’s plethysmograph.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
His experiments led him to the following conclusions:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Every agreeable impression produces an increase in the
volume of the arm and in the height of the pulse, with
increased depth of the respiratory cavity.</p>

<p class='c017'>A disagreeable impression, when weak, immediately
produces a diminution in the volume of the arm and the
height of the pulse; but almost at once the volume begins
to increase, notwithstanding the diminished pulse, and
usually passes beyond its normal state, even when the
pulse has returned to its first condition. If the impression
is strong but not painful these changes are accentuated,
and from the first are accompanied by deep inspirations.
Finally, if the impression is painful, not only considerable
changes of volume, but powerful respiratory movements and
disturbance of the voluntary muscles are produced.</p>

<p class='c017'>Disagreeable stimulation produces at first a spasm of
the superficial vessels, relaxation of the deep vessels, and
decreased fulness of the heart’s contractions. The first
two factors together produce a sudden and strong diminution
in the volume of the limbs. The last two factors
together produce a diminished height of pulse, and in
consequence of the enfeebled cardiac contractions there is
a stasis of the venous blood showing itself in the increased
volume of the limb.</p>

<p class='c017'>These bodily modifications, of which I have summarised
the chief features, are commonly regarded as the effects of
pain, and this opinion seems even to be accepted in many
works on psychology. The opinion cannot, however, be
accepted. Pain considered as a psychic event, an internal
fact, a pure state of consciousness, is not a cause but a
symptom. The cause is the stimulation (of whatever
nature) which, coming from the exterior environment, acts
on the external senses, or coming from the interior environment,
acts on the organic life. It is shown in two ways: on
the one hand in the state of consciousness which we call pain,
on the other by the physical phenomena above enumerated.
The consciousness expresses in one way what the organism
expresses in another way. This is not a mere opinion,
for experiment shows that circulatory, respiratory, and motor
modifications are produced when consciousness is probably
defective. Mantegazza has shown that if an intact animal
is subjected to pricks, cuts, and burns, cardiac troubles
follow; but that the same phenomena are produced after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the removal of the encephalon. François-Franck, investigating
the effects of painful stimulation on the heart, found
that the anæsthesia of chloroform suppresses troubles of
the heart, while, on the contrary, removal of the cerebral
hemispheres fails to abolish them. Formerly, Longet and
Vulpian maintained that in animals reduced to the medulla
and lower parts of the cerebro-spinal axis the cries and
movements that occur when they are pinched are
purely reflex; this interpretation has been contested by
Brown-Séquard. In human anencephalic (or headless)
monsters, cries, movements of suction and the like have
been observed during the few days they are able to live.
We must then admit either that the state of consciousness
we call pain can be produced in the absence of the brain,
or else that the physical phenomena can exist alone without
their psychic concomitant.</p>

<p class='c017'>Pain (as a state of consciousness) is only a sign, an index,
an internal event revealing to the individual his own disorganisation.
The only case in which pain is a cause is
when, being firmly fixed in consciousness and completely
filling it, it becomes an agent of destruction, but
then it is only a secondary cause. That is one of those
cases, so frequent in the sciences of life, in which what
is primarily an effect becomes in turn a cause. It is therefore
an error, though common to most psychologists, to
consider pain and pleasure as fundamental elements of the
affective life; they are only marks, the foundation is elsewhere.
What would be said of a doctor who confused
the symptoms of a disease with its essential nature?</p>

<p class='c017'>We touch here a point so important that it needs
emphasis. The thesis that pain is only a symptom, and
altogether, in spite of the sovereign part it plays in human
life, a superficial phenomenon in relation to the tendencies
which lie at the basis of the affective life, finds support in the
facts of <em>analgesia</em>, the disappearance of capacity to feel pain.
This insensibility presents itself under two forms: spontaneous
and artificial.</p>

<p class='c017'>Spontaneous analgesia is the rule in hysteria; it may vary
in degree, position, and extent. The demonologists of the
Middle Ages and the Renaissance knew these migrations of
insensibility to various parts of the body, and they sought
with care for the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>stigmata diaboli</i></span>, that is, the regions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>insensible to pain. Some authors assign to it a purely
psychic cause: painful impressions cannot be felt because
they are outside the field of consciousness, which in these
patients is in an almost permanently disassociated, scattered,
and destroyed state.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> It is, on the contrary, certain that an
intense fixed idea, profound concentration of attention,
fanatical exaltation, can produce temporary or permanent
analgesia. Many soldiers, in the heat of battle, have not
felt their wounds. Pascal, plunged in his problems, escaped
his neuralgias. The Aïssaouas, the fakirs, certain Lamas of
Thibet tear and cut themselves, secured against pain by
delirium, and one may well believe that many martyrs, in
the midst of their torture, have only experienced a sense of
rapture. In certain forms of insanity (maniacal excitement,
melancholia, idiocy, etc.) this spontaneous analgesia is frequent,
and takes on extraordinary forms. Numerous
examples may be found in special treatises.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> One crushes
glass in his mouth for half-an-hour without feeling any
pain. Another breaks his leg in a struggle, and a fragment
of the tibia projects through the torn skin, yet he continues
to pursue the object of his rage, and then sits down to eat
without the least sign of pain on his face. There are many
who, intentionally or by accident, plunge their arms into
boiling water or place them on a red-hot stove, until the skin
falls off in shreds, without appearing to be disturbed. An
endless series of such facts might be narrated.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The artificial analgesias, produced by chloroform and the
various anæsthetics employed in surgical operations, are
more instructive. It has been asked if the movements,
objurgations, and cries of some patients do not prove that
the analgesia is not complete, even when it seems so.
Richet has expressed the opinion that it is not consciousness
but recollection which is defective; he regards the pain
as so rapid that it is only a mathematical movement and
leaves no echo behind it, there being a series of evanescent
states of consciousness. It is quite possible to maintain
this hypothesis; but the most important fact recorded by
this author seems to me to be that, when pain has disappeared,
a certain degree of knowledge of it remains. In
other words, there is a process of scission: the feeling man
has disappeared, the <em>intellectual</em> man remains. In many
simple operations the contact of the instrument is often felt,
but not the pain. But there are more complex cases. "In
an operation for fissure of the anus with fistula, the patient
felt the contact of the scissors and easily distinguished four
incisions; she could not speak, but felt no suffering. In the
course of a similar operation I asked the patient, ‘How old
are you?’ She replied that she was forty-one, but when
restored to consciousness she could recall no sensation of
wound or burn and complained that the operation had not
taken place. I asked another during the operation, ‘How
are you getting on?’ the reply was, ‘Not badly.’ At the
same moment I pricked her vigorously; she felt nothing.
Again, in another case when I introduced a forceps into the
mouth to hold the tongue the patient said, ‘Take away
that cigarette.’ On awaking he could remember nothing.
Another when a quill was passed beneath his nose said,
‘Do not tickle me’ at the moment when the large arteries
were being tied, the most painful part of the operation.
Finally, a man under chloroform, while his spermatic cord was
being tied, heard the clock strike and tranquilly remarked,
‘Half-past eleven,’ recalling nothing when he awoke."<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>I have quoted these facts to show the extent to which
pain, as a state of consciousness, is <em>separable</em>, how it can
be added or cast off, and to what extent it presents the
character of an epiphenomenon.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>This relative independence of the pain-phenomenon,
against which the intellectualists have always rebelled,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
seems to me corroborated by the retardation which I have
already noted in passing. If we strike a corn while
walking, we feel the shock before the pain; the cold of the
knife is felt before the pain of the incision. Beau estimates
that pain is delayed seven-tenths of a second behind the
tactile impression. Burckhardt, by precise investigation,
fixes the rapidity of transmission in the cord at 12 m. 9 per
second for painful impressions, and 43 m. 3 for the others.
In certain diseases like tabes dorsalis the pain may be
separated from the needle-prick which causes it by from one
to two seconds. Many other facts may be quoted. If a
fold of the skin is seized in a pressure forceps, stopping at
the moment when the pressure is sufficient, pain, not felt at
first, gradually appears, coming in waves, and being at last
unbearable. A man whose thumb was seized in a machine
only knew of his injury by feeling his arm drawn, and only
began to suffer a quarter of an hour afterwards. It has
also been remarked that the syncope produced by violent
shocks and traumatism does not appear at once; between
the accident and the fainting several minutes may
elapse.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Pain is the result of a sum of impulses. Naunyn has
shown that, in tabes, a mechanical stimulus (like a hair on the
cutaneous surface of the foot), which is below the threshold
of consciousness both as contact and as pain, if repeated
from 60 to 600 times a second, is perceived at the end of
from six to twenty seconds, and soon becomes an intolerable
pain to the patient.</p>

<p class='c017'>Although excessive sensibility to pain (hyperalgesia) belongs
to the pathology of our subject, which will be dealt
with in a later chapter, it is necessary to say a few words
about it in contrasting it with analgesia, especially in view
of the conclusions here reached. This condition is more
difficult to observe than insensibility, because here there is
only a difference of degree, not the difference between being
and not being. But in some cases there is so great a
disproportion between the stimulus and the subject’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>reaction that we may say without hesitation that sensibility
is no longer normal.</p>

<p class='c017'>It has been observed, in a general manner, that the lower
races are not very sensitive to pain. Thus Negroes in Egypt
endure, almost without suffering, the most extensive surgical
operations (Pruner Bey), and Mantegazza (<i>op. cit.</i>, chap. xxvi.)
reports a large number of examples. In the peasant sensibility
is usually less keen than in the town-dweller, and it
may be admitted without hesitation that susceptibility to
pain increases with civilisation; what is called stoicism
should often be called a feeble degree of sensibility.
Hyperalgesia is best seen in cases of extreme nervous over-excitement.
In some it is generalised, constituting the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“supplicium neuricum,”</span> and the patient says that he is the
prey of unspeakable torments. It is less frequent in the
case of the special nerves, but is sometimes met. One
suffers from the slightest noise, and cannot tolerate the least
smell. Pitres quotes the case of a person who shut herself
up in a dark room, only coming out at night with a thick
shade against the rays of the stars. Those who entered her
dark room during the day had to wear sombre clothes,
completely concealing the shirt-collar, of which the white
reflection was horribly disagreeable to her.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Cutaneous
hyperalgesia is very common, sometimes extending over the
whole body, sometimes disseminated in patches. Weir
Mitchell, in his book on injuries of the nerves, reports
numerous examples; among others, a wounded soldier to
whom the mere crumpling of paper caused atrocious pain.
Opium-smokers, when they interrupt their habits, feel the
least breath of air as icy cold, and complain of intolerable
pains in all parts of the body. Hyperalgesia of the deep
tissues is also frequent among the hysterical and hypochondriacal.</p>

<p class='c017'>It must be remarked in passing that just as insensibility
to pain (analgesia) is independent of incapacity to receive
sensorial impressions (anæsthesia), so hyperalgesia is distinct
from hyperæsthesia. The latter is a power of perception
much surpassing the average; it is known that certain races
and individuals possess extraordinary visual, auditory, or
olfactive acuteness; the tactile hyperæsthesia of the blind
is also known, and in hypnotised subjects the delicacy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the senses has sometimes seemed miraculous. Hyperalgesia
then, like analgesia, shows that pain is relatively independent
of the sensations which arouse it.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>

<p class='c019'>We may conclude, from what goes before, that though
physical pain (of which alone I am speaking at present) is
always bound to an internal or external sensation, and forms
part of a psychic complexus, it may be separated and disjoined.
It has then its own conditions of existence, and
we may, in advance, say as much for pleasure.</p>

<p class='c017'>What are these conditions of existence? or, more simply,
what is pain in its nature? At the present time there are
two distinct doctrines on this point: one, which counts few
adherents, regards physical pain as properly a <em>sensation</em>; the
other, more generally admitted, regards it as a <em>quality</em> of
sensation, or more correctly, as an accompaniment, a concomitant.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The first, though recent in its complete form, is not
without antecedents. It found a momentary support in the
supposed discovery of pain-bearing nerves. Nichols, one of
the promoters of this hypothesis, has developed it in this
direction; but the attempt has proved futile. Strong,
one of its warmest partisans, supported himself on other
grounds. In his opinion the difficulty arises from the
ambiguity of the word pain, which may mean two things—displeasure
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Unlust</i></span>), or physical pain in the positive sense.
He reduces the latter to cuts, pricks, burns—in short, to
those pains that affect the skin. It is, in his opinion, strictly
a sensation like blue or red—not an attribute, but a substantive.
The pain of a burn, for instance, is a mixture of
two sensations, heat and pain. General sensibility is composed
of four kinds of sensibility: touch, heat, cold, and
pain. Each can be abolished separately. Cocaine and
chloroform suppress pain, not touch; saponine suppresses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>touch, not pain; syringomyelia destroys sensibility to pain
and heat, not touch; in some forms of neuritis there is
suppression of touch without analgesia. These various facts
are invoked as the chief arguments in favour of the hypothesis
of pain-sensation, though they may all be explained
also by the other doctrine.</p>

<p class='c017'>This hypothesis is full of difficulties. First, there is the
absence of anatomical basis, of special organs and nerves.
It will be necessary to return to this important point when
dealing with pleasure (Chap. iii.). Nichols tells us that
there is nothing to prove that nerves of pain do not exist,
though they have not been experimentally established—which
is indeed something; that histological research could
not determine in the peripheral apparatus what belongs to
touch and what belongs to pain; and that proof must be
deduced from cases of tactile sensation without pain and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>—which fails to constitute any degree of proof.
Moreover, the distinction set up between displeasure
(moral pain?) and physical pain is arbitrary, factitious,
wholly unjustified. There is, however, a still less admissible
distinction. Strong expressly declares that he
limits himself to pains localised on the cutaneous surface.
Now by what right can we cut off the group of physical—strictly
physical—pains, the states of torture originating
in the internal organs, the multiple neuralgias
as intolerable as any external pain, without speaking of
discomfort, prostration, exhaustion? Are these also sensations,
or something else? We are not told. Finally—and
Strong himself has stated the objection—it must be
acknowledged that we should here have a strange kind
of sensations which do not externalise themselves. While
other impressions, visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactive,
are referred to causes which provoke them, the pains
of a prick, a cut, a burn remain strictly subjective and are
not located in the needle, the knife, the burning coal, as we
locate a sound in the bell, a bitter taste in absinth. The
only possible reply (which the partisans of pain-sensation
have not made) would be that this phenomenon has a character
of its own; it always remains a sensation, and never
becomes a perception, whence the absence of externalisation.
But then why assimilate it to blue or red? Moreover, pain-sensation,
as it exists in the adult, approaches so closely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the affective state, that what is essential in the doctrine of
pain-sensation vanishes. Whatever may be thought of the
probability of some future discovery of terminal organs for
physical pain, as Rutgers Marshall remarks, it must be
agreed that there is no proof of the existence in the
environment of a special stimulus to which physical pain
specially corresponds, and for that reason also it would
be a great mistake to place in the well-determined class
“sensation,” a mental state which lacks one of the most
marked characteristics of sensation in general. That conclusion
is mine also.</p>

<p class='c017'>The opposite doctrine, which has of late been called the
<em>quale</em>-theory, is often maintained in an unsatisfactory form,
because in fact it reduces itself to an affirmation of <em>quantity</em>.
The pain which accompanies sensation may depend either
on its intensity or on its quality alone.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is needless to insist on the first case, since many old
authors never cease repeating that the painful impression is
the result of a stimulation which is strong, intense, violent,
prolonged.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the contrary, it is necessary to remark that this
exclusive affirmation cannot be applied everywhere and
always. This evidently appears in the cases of hyperalgesia,
which is the reason why I brought them forward. The very
disagreeable sensation which is caused by a knife against the
skin certainly comes from the nature rather than the intensity
of the stimulus. Beaunis remarks that certain odours, tastes,
and contacts are painful at once, and do not need to be intense.
Did the contact of the quill which threw Weir
Mitchell’s patient into a state of anguish act by its intensity?
No doubt we must recognise that hyperalgesias constitute
a group apart, not strictly comparable with ordinary cases;
they are pathological forms, variable in degree; but the
pathological is merely an exaggeration of the normal. The
error of those who refer pain solely to intensity of stimulation
is in considering <em>objective</em> conditions only; they forget the
part played by the sentient subjects. Pains which depend
on the quality of the stimulus are especially of <em>subjective</em>
origin, because the degree of excitability in the patient’s
nervous elements is the essential ruling factor.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we admit that these two conditions—intensity and
quality—act one upon the other, what afterwards happens?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>What is the intimate nature of the pain-producing process?
The hypothesis which is most natural and simple,
and in agreement with the mechanical conceptions predominant
in the biological sciences, would be founded on
the admission that pain corresponds to a particular form of
movement. On this supposition, the affective nervous
road, from the periphery to the centres, would be traversed
by three different kinds of movement or of molecular disturbance:
the first giving birth to pure sensation, that is to
say a state of knowledge, an intellectual state; the second,
which may or may not be present, giving birth to pain;
the third, also either present or absent, giving birth to
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is another possible hypothesis, quite different from
the others, which I should be willing to accept, but which
cannot be presented as more than a theory. It would
consist in attributing the genesis of pain to <em>chemical modifications</em>
in the tissues and nerves, especially the production of
local or general toxins in the organism. Pain would thus
be one of the forms of auto-intoxication. Oppenheimer alone
seems to me to have worked in this direction.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> In his
opinion, as regards the origin of pain, “the real cause, in any
sensorial or other organ, resides in a change in the tissues,
especially a chemical change, by which either the products
of destruction rise above the normal average, or else
modifications result from the presence of a foreign body
in the organism.” The connection between the peripheral
tissues and the centres would be by the vaso-motor nerves
(constrictor or dilator). The tissues would be the terminal
organs of pain, the vaso-motors the paths of conduction.
In organs which only undergo slight changes when active
(tendons, ligaments, bones, etc.) conscious sensibility
is almost absent. “Pain is not, as many believe, the
highest degree of sensation produced in the organs of
special sense; it is the most intense sensation produced
in the vaso-motor nerves under the influence of violent
stimulation.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This hypothesis will perhaps be justified by the future.
I shall return to it when studying the emotions. We shall
then see that these are accompanied by deep and well-established
chemical modifications in the organism.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Physical pain is a large subject, which, as may be seen,
has not been neglected of late, and concerning which there
is still much to say. It is not possible, however, to deal
further with it here, since it only occupies a limited area
in the psychology of the emotions.</p>

establish that, on the contrary, there is a fundamental
<em>identity</em> between physical and moral pain, and that they
only differ from each other in the point of departure, the
first being connected with a sensation, the second with
some form of representation, an image or an idea.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>At first sight it seems paradoxical, and to many even
revolting, to maintain that the pain caused by a corn or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>boil, that expressed by Michelangelo in his sonnets concerning
his inability to reach his ideal, or that felt by a
delicate conscience at the sight of crime, are identical in
their nature. I purposely bring together these extreme
cases. Yet there is no call for indignation if we remember
that we are concerned with the pain alone, not
with the events which provoke it, these latter being extra-affective
phenomena. The best method of justifying our
thesis, however, is to follow the evolution of moral pain in
its ascending march from its lowest to its highest point.
It will suffice to note the chief stages.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>First Period.</i>—Moral pain is at first connected with an
extremely simple representation, a concrete image—that is
to say, the immediate copy of a perception. It may be
defined as the ideal reproduction of physical pain. It only
presupposes a single condition, memory. The child who has
had to swallow an unpleasant remedy, or who has had a
tooth extracted, experiences when the next occasion
approaches a pain which may be called physical, since it
is connected with a simple image, of which it is the
weakened copy and echo. It may be said in the language
of mathematicians, that in this case the moral pain is to the
physical pain as the image is to the perception. This form
is so simple as to be found in many animals not reckoned
among the highest. It is not yet moral pain—grief or
sorrow—in the complete and rigorous sense, but it must be
noted, because it corresponds to what naturalists call a
transitional form.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Second Period.</i>—It is connected with complex representations
and forms a very large class, the manifestations of
which are the only ones met with in average human beings.
At this stage moral pain presupposes reflection, or, more
explicitly, first the faculty of reasoning (deductive or inductive),
and secondly constructive imagination. It would be
possible to quote a crowd of examples, taken at random:
the news of a death, of an illness, of ruin, of frustrated
ambition, etc. The point of departure is a dry and
simple fact, but the pain attaches itself to all the <em>perceived</em>
results which flow from it. Thus ruin means a series of
privations, wretchednesses, labours begun over again,
fatigues, and exhaustions. It is in this detailed translation,
varying according to individuals and cases, that moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>pain lies. It is clear, and is proved by observation, that the
man endowed with an ardent and constructive imagination
will feel intense pain when another, with a poor and cold
imagination, remains indifferent, seeing nothing in his misfortune
but the present actual fact—that is to say, a very
little thing; the sum of pains evoked is proportional to
the sum of representations evoked. The child remains
insensible at the news of death or ruin; if he is moved
it is through imitation; there is nothing in his experience
enabling him to deduce what these fatal words contain,
and to represent the future.</p>

<p class='c017'>Moral pain presents itself under various forms—positive,
negative, or mixed.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the positive form it is an expenditure of movement, the
representation of an exhaustive labour, of an incessant effort
to begin again what is already felt in consciousness by
anticipation. Such is the case of the candidate who fails at
an examination to which he must go up again.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the negative form it is an arrest of movement, a
lessening, the consciousness of a deficit, a privation,
cravings ceaselessly arising and ceaselessly disappointed.
The death of a beloved person is the most perfect example.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the mixed form we may see it in the ruined millionaire,
the dethroned king, who set to work again to reconstruct the
past. On the one hand the representation of the long
labour of a new conquest; on the other, tendencies of all
sorts which were formerly satisfied, and are now inexorably
brought to a stop.</p>

<p class='c017'>A complete study of the second group of moral pains
would include two moments: the egoistic form, the first in
date, and the sympathetic or altruistic form. The latter
seems to appear early, since Darwin noted it at the age of
six months and eleven days in one of his children, who was
much affected when his nurse pretended to be unhappy and
cry. Preyer even alleges, as we have seen, that grief appears
at the age of four months. This sympathetic form of pain
is found in certain animals, especially those living in society.
In certain monogamous couples the death of one of the
partners may cause the other to perish. I will not pause
here at present to describe these two great forms of the
affective life which will occupy us so often in the course of
this study.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><i>Third Period.</i>—Grief in this case is connected with pure
concepts or with ideal representations. This is intellectual
pain, which is much rarer, and produces little effect, at all
events for any length of time, on the ordinary man. Such
is the pain of the religious person who feels he is not
sufficiently devout, of the metaphysician tormented by
doubt, of the poet and the artist, conscious of an abortive
creation, of the man of science who unsuccessfully pursues
the solution of a problem.</p>

<p class='c017'>These forms of pain are chiefly negative and secondarily
positive. They consist, first, in unsatisfied needs, privations,
lacunæ in existence; afterwards in effort, expenditure
of force, fatigue, achieving nothing.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Having shown that the pain-phenomenon, in the course
of evolution, attaches itself to representations more and
more elevated and finally to superior conceptions, we will
examine moral pain objectively, <em>from without</em>, to show
afresh its identity with physical pain, or, more exactly, to
prove that pain is invariable in its nature, under whatever
form it manifests itself.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Grief is accompanied by the same modifications in the
organism as physical pain. It is needless to repeat the
description: circulatory disturbance, constriction of the
vaso-motors, syncope; decrease of respiration or constant
changes in its rhythm, sudden or prolonged reverberation on
nutrition, loss of appetite, indigestion, arrest or diminution
of secretions, vomiting. I may remark that rapid change of
colour in the hair, already noted, is specially met with in
violent moral shocks (Marie-Antoinette, Ludovico Sforza,
etc.). The voluntary muscles of the larynx, the face, the
whole body, undergo the same influences and express them
in the same ways. For moral as for physical pain, there are
silent forms and agitated forms.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. If we admit the old maxim: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Naturam morborum
medicationes ostendunt,”</span> as we see every day the same
general therapeutics applied to both forms of pain, we have
here evidence in favour of their identity: no doubt there
are curative methods proper to each; for moral pain, consolations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>distractions, travel; but are not opium, sedatives,
and tonics employed to relieve both?</p>

<p class='c017'>3. I brought together at the beginning of this chapter the
grossest forms of physical pain and the most refined forms
of moral pain; but there are composite forms in which
sensations and representations seem to form an equilibrium,
so that such painful states might be entered under either
head. This is the case with certain melancholics of whom
I shall have to speak later, but we may take as a type the
hypochondriacal person in whom we find the point of
junction of the two pains. The physical troubles of
hypochondriasis have often been described. There are
localised pains, but in addition a large number of simply
represented pains, enlarged as by a lens, and referred to
the lungs, the heart, the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, the
stomach, the intestines. The joints are cracking; there are
conjectures concerning the appearance of the face, the
tongue, the urine, and above all what perpetual anxiety!
One of them said: “I feel better to-day, and that makes
me anxious; it is not natural.” Is this physical pain or moral
pain? Sometimes one, sometimes the other predominates,
according to the individual and the moment. Clouston has
observed that in melancholics sadness often diminishes
when physical pain increases. They are so intimately intertwined
that no point of departure can be established
between them. This morbid state is worthy of mention
because it also is a transitional form. We need have no
hesitation in generalising, and saying that there is no
physical (that is to say, localised) pain, however slight,
unaccompanied by some fugitive mental irritation, and
no mental irritation unaccompanied by some slight physical
troubles.</p>

<p class='c017'>The foregoing does not imply that grief is a very refined
physical pain, or that it arises therefrom, as—according
to the well-known formula: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nihil est in intellectu quod non
prius fuerit in sensu</i></span>—it is supposed that the superior forms
of knowledge arise from sensation alone. That would be a
misconstruction. Physical pain is not a genus of which
moral pain is a species. The thesis which I maintain is
that pain is always identical with itself, that it has its own
conditions of existence, that the innumerable modes which
it presents to us in the physical order and in the moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>order are related to the sensorial or intellectual elements
which excite and envelop it.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The question still remains why certain representations
have the unfortunate privilege of arousing pain. This is a
question which I can only touch on, because it belongs to
another part of the subject. For the moment I simply
reply that it is because they are the beginning of mental
disorganisation, just as physical pain is the beginning of
physical disorganisation. The sentient being, man or
animal, is a bundle of needs, of appetites, of physical or
psychic tendencies; everything that suppresses or impedes
them is translated into pain. Physical suffering is the blind
and unconscious reaction of the organism to every hurtful
action. Grief is the conscious reaction to every decrease of
psychic life. The man shut in by narrow and commonplace
surroundings would certainly feel no æsthetic pain, because
having no need of æsthetic satisfaction he could not be
impoverished or impeded by its absence.</p>

<p class='c017'>In short, pain under all its forms reveals an identical
nature. The distinction between physical pain and moral
pain is practical, not scientific.</p>

<p class='c016'>In treating of grief, one is apt to be embarrassed by the
abundance of documents, and the difficulty of being brief;
in dealing with pleasure the contrary is the case. Are
we to conclude that this is because, for centuries past,
physicians have been collecting observations on pain,
while there exists no profession having for its object the
observation of pleasure? Or is it because humanity is so
constituted as to suffer more from pain than it can enjoy
from pleasure, and therefore studies everything relating to
pain in order to find deliverance therefrom, while accepting
everything agreeable naturally and without reflection? We
cannot, however, accuse psychologists of having neglected
this study, although the bibliography of Pleasure is very
scanty compared with that of Pain. In general, they have
considered these two subjects as complementary to one
another, pleasure and pain being opposed to each other as
contraries, so that the knowledge of the one implies the
knowledge of the other. But this is only a hypothesis—perhaps
true, perhaps false—resting in great part only on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the testimony of consciousness, which is always open to
question and never above suspicion. “It may be,” says
Beaunis, very justly, “that pleasure and pain, which seem
to us two opposite and mutually contradictory phenomena,
may in the end be nothing but phenomena of the same
nature, only differing in degree. It is possible that they
may be phenomena of different orders, but incapable of
such comparison with one another as would enable us to
declare one contrary to the other. It is possible that they
may depend simply on a difference of excitability in the
nervous centres. Again, it is possible that they may be
included, sometimes in one category, sometimes in the
<a id='corr49.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='other.’'>other.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_49.13'><ins class='correction' title='other.’'>other.”</ins></a></span><a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The formulas universally made use of in characterising
pleasure indicate this vague position of the problem:
“Agreeable states are the correlatives of actions which
conduce to the well-being or preservation of the individual.”
“Generally speaking, pleasures are the concomitants of
medium activities, where the activities are of kinds liable
to be in excess or in defect” (Herbert Spencer). “Experience
attests that, in all the sensory regions, sensations of
moderate energy are specially accompanied by a feeling of
pleasure. Thus this feeling connects itself with the sensations
of tickling due to cutaneous excitations of slight
energy” (Wundt). According to this writer, the gamut
of pleasure is less rich and extensive than that of pain,
and he finds the proof of this assertion in the language
expressive of universal experience. “Language,” he says,
“has created numerous expressions for disagreeable feelings,
emotions, and inclinations, while the joyful moods of the
mind are dismissed with a brief general designation. This
phenomenon arises less from the fact that man observes with
especial care and minuteness his disagreeable or troublesome
states, than from the greater uniformity which pleasurable
feelings in reality possess. This is particularly evident
in the case of the sensory feelings [those connected with
the sensations]. Pain has not only numerous degrees of
energy, but numberless gradations according to its seat.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Mantegazza, when determining the synonyms of pleasure,
appears to uphold the contrary view.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a> For my own part, I
am of Wundt’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c017'>The anatomical and physiological conditions of the
genesis and transmission of pleasure are a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terra incognita</i></span>.
In cases of physical pleasure, what takes place at the
peripheral terminations, in the nerves, in the cerebro-spinal
axis? Most authors do not even propound these
questions. The physiology of pain, in spite of its uncertainties,
is rich and instructive compared with that of
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c017'>In recent times it has been maintained that pleasure, as
well as grief, ought to be regarded as a <em>sensation</em>, not as the
concomitant of various psychic states; that both are fundamental
senses having their own proper nervous energies
distinct from other sensations. In other words, the expression,
“sensations of pleasure and pain,” ought to be
taken in the strict sense borne by the word sensation. I
have already touched on this point in treating of pain, but
it may not be out of place to return to it here; for, apart
from its hypothetical character, I cannot think this assertion
a happy one. In fact, if there is any psychological state
clearly delimited and differentiated from all others, it is
sensation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Sensation is determined and circumscribed by a special
organ serving for this purpose only, as in the case of sight,
hearing, etc., or at least by special nerves and special
peripheral terminations, as in the case of touch, and
temperature. Internal sensations, in spite of the nervous
apparatus proper to them, have a vaguer character; hence
some psychologists call them indifferently sensations or
feelings. The kinæsthetic sensations, or those of movement,
long included under the designation of muscular
sense (an improper term, gradually falling out of use),
have, though diffused through the organism, nerves
peculiar to themselves; those of the muscular tissue, the
articulations (the periosteum, the ligaments, the synovial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>membranes, the tendons). But pleasure and pain have
neither special nerves nor special organs. We have seen
the opinion admitted with regard to the pain-bringing
nerves; as for the nerves of pleasure, I know no author
who has hazarded such a hypothesis, however tentatively.
It is true that one of those who admit the existence of
nerves of pain (Frey) gets out of the difficulty very easily
by saying that pleasure, consisting only in the absence of
pain, requires no special nerves. May we not say, then,
that it is a complete falsification of the meaning of words
to class among sensations psychical phenomena answering
to none of the required anatomical or physiological conditions?<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The manifestations taking place within the organism are
better known when we are in a condition of pleasure. Let
us take as typical the constant pleasures, putting aside those
which, by their exuberance, as we shall see later on, border
on pathological forms. Whether the point of departure is
a physical excitation, a representation, or a concept, two
distinct events take place, as in the case of grief: on the
one hand an internal state of consciousness, which we
describe as agreeable; on the other a bodily external
condition, of which the following are the principal characteristics.</p>

<p class='c017'>Taken as a whole, they may be opposed, almost point for
point, to the description already given of the physical
manifestations of grief, and betray a heightening of the vital
functions. This contrast is not without importance in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>favour of the common thesis which regards pleasure and
pain as a pair of opposites.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The circulation increases, especially in the brain, as
shown by various symptoms, in particular the increased
lustre of the eyes. The experiments of Lehmann, already
quoted (Chapter I.), prove that physical, as well as æsthetic
pleasure, is accompanied by dilatation of the vessels and an
increase of the heart’s contractions.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>2. The same thing is to be observed with regard to the
respiration, which becomes more active; in consequence,
the temperature of the body rises, and the nutritive
exchanges, becoming more rapid, result in a rich alimentation
of the organs and tissues. “In joy, all parts
of the body receive advantage, and are likely to last longer;
the cheerful and contented man is well nourished and
remains young. It is a truism that people in good health
are contented” (Lange). Joy also tends to make the
secretions (lacteal, spermatic, etc.) more abundant.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The innervation of the voluntary muscles expresses
itself by exuberance of movements, by joyful exclamations,
laughter, and singing. Certain cases of extreme and sudden
joy have been known to produce all the effects of alcoholic
intoxication. Sir H. Davy danced in his laboratory after
making the discovery of potassium. At the London International
Congress of Psychology (1892), Münsterberg
communicated the following experiments under the title
of “The Psychological Foundation of the Feelings.” A
line ten centimetres in length is drawn with the right
hand. When this movement has been thoroughly practised,
it should be repeated with closed eyes, passing the hand
first from right to left, with a movement of centripetal
flexion, then from left to right, with a movement of centrifugal
extension. In such a case mistakes will be made,
sometimes in the one direction, sometimes in the other.
Let us repeat the same experiments under the influence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>certain affective states (sadness, gaiety, anger, etc.), noting
all errors and their direction. Münsterberg has discovered
them to be determined by a very exact law. In vexation,
the extensor movements (centrifugal) are too short (average
error, 10 mm.), and the flexor movements (centripetal) too
long, the average excess being 12 mm. In joy, on the other
hand, the centrifugal movements are in excess by (on an
average) 10 mm., and the centripetal movements too
short by an average of 20 mm. From this he concludes
that, in pleasure, motion tends to increase; in pain, to
diminish.</p>

<p class='c017'>The manifestations of joy may be summed up in a single
word—dynamogeny. Joy produces energy.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is superfluous to say that we consider pleasure, for the
same reasons as pain, to be an additional phenomenon, a
symptom, a sign, a mark, denoting the satisfaction of certain
tendencies; and that it cannot be regarded as a fundamental
element of the life of the feelings. Like pain,
pleasure is separable from the complex of which it forms
part, and under certain abnormal conditions may totally
disappear. <em>Anhedonia</em> (if I may coin a counter-designation
to analgesia) has been very little studied, but it exists. I
need not say that the employment of anæsthetics suppresses
at the same time pain and its contrary; but there are cases
of an insensibility relating to pleasure alone. “The sensation
of sexual pleasure is, in very rare cases, subject to
lesions affecting no other part of the organism. Brown-Séquard
saw two cases of special sexual anæsthesia, all
other kinds of sensibility, those of the urethral mucous membrane
and the skin, still persisting. Althaus quotes another
case. It would no doubt be possible to find such cases in
larger numbers were it not for the false modesty which
prevents patients from speaking of the subject. Fonssagrives
cites a very remarkable example observed in a woman.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
This insensibility exists not only for physical but also for
moral pleasure (joy, high spirits, etc.). Apart from the
cases of profound melancholy, which will occupy us later on,
where the individual is untouched by the slightest impulse
of joy, there are cases of anhedonia which seem simpler
and clearer. “Antoine Cros mentions the case of a patient,
a young girl, suffering from congested liver and spleen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>which of course altered the state of her blood, and thus,
for a time, modified her constitution. Her moral character
was greatly altered by it. She ceased to feel any affection
for father or mother; would play with her doll, but could
not be brought to show any delight in it; could not be
drawn out of her apathetic sadness. Things which previously
had made her shriek with laughter now left her
uninterested. Her temper changed, became capricious and
violent.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Esquirol has recorded the case of a magistrate,
a very intelligent man, suffering from a liver complaint.
“Every affection seemed to be dead in him. He showed
neither perversion nor violence, but there was complete
absence of emotive reaction. If he went to the theatre (as
he continued to do from force of habit) he could find no
pleasure there. Thoughts of his house, his home, his wife,
his absent children, affected him no more, he said, than a
theorem of Euclid.” We have here a specimen of what we
may call a purely intellectual existence—that of the Wise
Man of the Stoics.</p>

<p class='c017'>These facts—and we shall find analogous ones in other
chapters, under other headings—show that, as we have seen
in the case of pain, pleasure does not depend simply on the
<em>quantity</em> of excitement. To attribute all pleasures to excitements
of medium energy is equivalent to the formula:
“Pain is due to an intense and prolonged excitement.”
In both cases intensity alone is emphasised; but there are
pleasures irreducible to medium energy and depending on
the <em>quality</em> of the excitement and the nature of the sentient
subject. Will it be said that sexual pleasures are the concomitants
of a medium activity? The pleasure produced
by harmonious chords is, for a musical ear, a matter of
quality, not of intensity. We find it impossible, therefore,
to reduce the objective conditions of pleasure to a single
formula.</p>

<p class='c017'>Although general opinion has established a distinction
between sensory and spiritual pleasures, this distinction is
purely theoretical. Pleasure, as an affective state, always
remains identical with itself; its numerous varieties are
determined only by the intellectual condition originating
it—sensation, image, concept. It would be tedious to
repeat in detail the analysis already given of pain in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>to apply it to pleasure; it will be sufficient to indicate the
principal points.</p>

<p class='c017'>All forms of pleasure are accompanied by the organic
modifications previously enumerated. Primarily, it can only
be physical—<i>i.e.</i>, combined with a sensation, such as the
pleasure of a soft, warm contact, the satisfaction of hunger
and thirst in children and animals. Then pleasure becomes
an anticipation, as in the case of a dog when his food is
being brought to him; to employ the term used by Herbert
Spencer, it is a presentative-representative state. Then, in
this ascending evolution, pleasure appears attached to pure
representations. This—as in the case of pain—is the main
group, that of the varied and numerous joys which console
humanity for its sufferings; these, too, are divided into
egoistic and sympathetic pleasures. There remain the
highest and rarest manifestations attached to pure concepts—the
pleasures of æsthetic creation, those of the
metaphysician or the man of science. We might further
show how the transition from pleasure, considered as strictly
physical (that of the thirsty man drinking a cool beverage
in long draughts), to the subtlest, most ethereal intellectual
pleasures, may in fact be gradually traced step by step;
that the two elements—sensory and representative—are
always coexistent, and that we qualify any given pleasure
solely according to the preponderance of one or the other.
Finally, if we have found in hypochondriasis a composite
form, which might be classed with equal justice as a
physical or moral pain, in the domain of pleasure it is not
difficult to discover analogous forms. The æsthetic pleasure
called forth by forms, by colours, and especially by sounds,
affords us an example. It is incontestable that these three
kinds of sensation can, unassisted, in and by themselves,
produce a sensory pleasure. Certain colours, certain
qualities of sound, certain chords, produce at once an
agreeable impression. Then the representations evoked by
memory excite, in their turn, a degree of pleasure quite
distinct from the original sensations. Fechner, in his
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Vorschule der Æsthetik</cite></span>, distinguishes, in his analysis of the
elements of the Beautiful, the direct factor, <i>i.e.</i> sensation,
and the indirect or associative factor, that is to say, the
associated ideas evoked. These two coexistent factors are
only separable by psychological analysis, and the position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>established by Fechner for the intellectual elements has its
equivalent for the emotional states.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The generally accepted formula connecting pleasure with
medium activities is supported by a commonly observed
fact—viz., that pleasure carried to excess or continued too
long often transforms itself into its opposite. The pleasures
of eating may lead to nausea, tickling soon becomes a
torture, as well as heat and cold, and one cannot endure even
a favourite melody when played for two consecutive hours.
In a word, a sensation or representation at first agreeable
may, either gradually or suddenly, be found to have its
opposite associated with it. While the sensory or intellectual
element remains the same—at least in appearance—the
affective state is changed.</p>

<p class='c017'>So familiar an occurrence, well known from the remotest
antiquity, from which various consequences have been
deduced by philosophers, would not in itself possess
sufficient importance to arrest our attention, did it not,
for all its insignificant appearance, afford us the opportunity
of penetrating the depths of our subject.</p>

<p class='c017'>We may remark that the same transformation takes place
inversely—a state in itself disagreeable may become agreeable.
This transmutation is to be found at the root of
nearly all the pleasures which we call <em>acquired</em>: a taste or
smell at first repugnant may become delightful.</p>

<p class='c017'>The same thing happens with regard to certain physical
exercises connected with touch and the muscular sense.
The use of alcoholic drinks, of tobacco, of all sorts of
narcotics, would furnish us with abundance of examples.
Pleasure is found in certain forms of literature which were
at first found revolting; the same thing may be said of
painting; and the history of music is one long piece of
evidence in favour of this transformation of tastes.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the first place, we have to note that the hackneyed
expression, “transformation” of pleasure into pain, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice
versâ</i></span>, is inaccurate. Pain cannot be changed into pleasure
or pleasure into pain, any more than black can be changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>into white. What is meant is that the conditions of
existence of the one disappear to give place to the conditions
of existence of the other. There is succession, but
not transformation; a symptom does not transform itself
into its opposite.</p>

<p class='c017'>This succession, abrupt or gradual, leads us to ask whether
there might not be a common basis, a certain identity of
nature, between the two antagonistic phenomena. The
question thus put may be answered by one of two alternative
hypotheses.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The admission that the difference is fundamental and
irreducible, that pain is as clearly to be distinguished
from pleasure as the visual sensation is from the auditory
sensation: that these feelings constitute an antinomy—an
irreconcilable antagonism. The clearest affirmation of this
thesis is found in those writers who make pleasure and pain
“sensations” comparable to other sensations, and having
their own specific character.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The admission that the difference is one of degree, not
of nature; that the two contrary manifestations are only two
<em>moments</em> of the same process; that they differ from each
other only as sound differs from noise, or a very acute sound
from a very deep one, both resulting from the same cause—the
number of vibrations in any given space of time. I am
myself inclined to maintain this second hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us take as an example a simple case where the
process is manifested in its totality. We have a person in
a so-called indifferent, neutral, or medium state, that is to
say, one which cannot be described as agreeable or painful;
the individual is simply alive, that is all. He is sensitive to
the perfume of flowers; some are placed in his room—pleasure
is the result. At the end of an hour all is changed;
the subject is incommoded by the smell of the flowers, and
avoids them. Hence we have three successive moments:
indifference, pleasure, pain.</p>

<p class='c017'>But these three moments in consciousness have their
correlatives in the modifications of the organism: circulation,
respiration, motion, the various phases of nutrition.
The first answers to the average vital formula of the individual;
the second to an increase in the vital functions, and,
according to the usual formula (which we shall examine
later on), to an augmentation of energy; the third to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>lowering of the vital functions and a diminution of energy.
Such are the data of observation and experience. Féré’s
researches on the olfactory sensations (to mention no
others) have shown that the feelings accompanying them,
pleasant or otherwise, show themselves in an augmented
or diminished pressure on the dynamometer. In a subject
whose dynamometric force is normally 50-55, a disagreeable
odour lowers the index to 45, an agreeable one raises it to
65. In another (a hysterical patient) the odour of musk, at
first very pleasant, raises the dynamometer from 23 to 46;
in three minutes it becomes disagreeable, and the pressure
sinks to 19.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> We find, therefore, that the organism is
subject to perpetual fluctuations, indicated in the consciousness
by agreeable or disagreeable feelings: the two opposites
are connected with one and the same cause, the vital
functions forming their common basis; and I should be
inclined to propound the following hypothesis:—</p>

<p class='c017'>In most cases, if not in all, two contrary processes are
going on simultaneously—one of increase, the other of
diminution; <em>what comes into the consciousness is only the
result of a difference</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>A difference between what? Between receipt and expenditure.
Let us, in order to show this clearly, take a
point at which the destructive and constructive activities
exactly balance one another, a condition corresponding
to the neutral or indifferent state of psychologists, and let
us represent the same by the numerical formula 50 = 50.
At a subsequent point of time the destructive activities
predominate; let us suppose them equal to 60, while the
value of the constructive falls to 40. On comparing the
second moment with the first, we find a negative difference
of -20, whose psychic equivalent is a painful state of consciousness.
Let us then suppose a third moment, when
the constructive activities are in the ascendent and equal
60, while the destructive fall to 40; there will be a positive
difference of +20, whose psychic equivalent is a pleasant
state of consciousness. I must beg the reader to take all
this only by way of illustration.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus understood, the “transformation” of pleasure into
pain, and pain into pleasure, is only the translation into
the order of affective psychology of the fundamental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>rhythm of life. The latter reduces itself to the ultimate
fact of nutrition, consisting of two mutually interdependent
processes, one of which implies the other, assimilation and
dissimilation. Except in extreme cases, such as inanition
and exhaustion on the one hand, and plethora on the
other, in which one of the two processes prevails almost
without counterpoise, they usually oscillate on either side of
a medium, as pleasure and pain do on either side of an
alleged neutral state. In physiology it happens that a
very clear and easily verified phenomenon covers and hides
a contrary phenomenon, so that the principal part of the
occurrence is erroneously taken for the whole. Thus one
knows that a muscle is heated by exercise, which seems to
contravene the law of the transformation of energy, as the
mechanical work done ought to consume a part of that
mode of motion which we call heat. Béclard and several
others after him have shown that there is a real lowering of
temperature at the beginning of positive work, and that two
opposite phenomena appear in the muscle when in action:
one physical, absorbing heat and determining a cooling of
the active muscle; the other chemical, producing a heating
of the muscle. The latter masks the former. In the same
way, the well-known experiments of Schiff have shown that
the brain is heated when it receives impressions and elaborates
them; it ought to grow cold, since it is doing work;
but Tanzi’s experiments seem to establish the existence of
alternating oscillations of cold and heat while the brain
is at work. We recall these facts, though not in direct
relation to our subject, to show that the coexistence of two
opposite processes, the most apparent of which conceals
the other, is not a chimera. There are frequently two
simultaneous phenomena, of which the one is seen and not
the other.</p>

<p class='c017'>According to this hypothesis, then, the conditions of
existence of pleasure and pain are implied the one by the
other, and always coexistent. What is expressed by
consciousness is a <em>surplus</em>, and what is called their transformation
is only a difference in favour of one or the other.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>I add some final remarks on the so-called transformation
of pain into pleasure. Being rarer than its opposite, it
presents some peculiarities to be noted.</p>

<p class='c017'>Very acute pleasures exhaust quickly—a condition very
favourable to the rapid appearance of pain; I do not see
that acute pain ever changes into pleasure, except perhaps
in a few cases to be examined in the following chapter.</p>

<p class='c017'>The “transformation” does not take place abruptly, but
always by a gradual transition.</p>

<p class='c017'>Some have attempted to explain it by habit; but this
is so general a term as to require fresh definition in each
individual case. It has also been said that the painful
sensation, being accompanied by disorganisation and
lowering of the vital power, produces, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span>, an
organic repair, a vital increase, which is the essential condition
of pleasure. But this does not prove that the period
of reintegration coexists with the first impression and
imparts to it a contrary affective sign. The novice in the
use of tobacco is at first incommoded by headache, nausea,
etc.; then there follows a period of repair, but it is not
directly connected with the act of smoking.</p>

<p class='c017'>It seems to me preferable to admit, with Beaunis, that
the agreeable states we speak of are not simple but complex,
consisting of a certain number of elements. “It may
happen that, among the elements which compose sensation,
some are agreeable and some painful; with habit and
exercise the painful element gradually disappears from
the consciousness, and only the agreeable elements of the
sensation remain. In this case there would not really be
a transformation of the pain into pleasure, but an extinction,
a disappearance of the disagreeable elements of the sensation,
and a predominance of the agreeable ones.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The cause of this change seems to me to lie in the biological
function called adaptation, of whose true nature very little is
known, and which appears to reduce itself to nutritive modifications.
Experiment shows that its efficacy cannot be
depended on: it succeeds in some persons, but fails in others.</p>

<p class='c016'>The title of this chapter may seem paradoxical, pleasure
being as a rule the expression of health, and even of
exuberant life, and pain, by its very definition, a diseased
state. It must be admitted that, for the latter, the expression
<em>abnormal</em> would be preferable. However, the facts
we are about to study are not rare, and deserve separate
examination, because the deviations and anomalies of
pleasure and pain serve to make the nature of each better
understood.</p>

<p class='c017'>Taking our subject, for the first time, on the pathological
side, a proceeding to be applied later on to each of the
simple or complex emotions in turn, certain preliminary
remarks are indispensable.</p>

<p class='c017'>The application of the pathological method to psychology
needs no justification; its efficacy has been proved. The
results obtained are too numerous and too well known to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>need enumeration. This method, in fact, has two principal
advantages—(1) it is a magnifying instrument, amplifying
the normal phenomenon; hallucination explains the part
played by the image, and hypnotic suggestion throws light
on the suggestion met with in ordinary life; (2) it is a
valuable instrument of analysis. Pathology, it has justly
been remarked, is only physiology out of order, and nothing
leads better to the understanding of a machine than the
elimination or the deviation of one of its wheels. Aphasia
produces a decomposition of memory and its different signs,
which the subtlest psychological analysis could not attempt
or even suspect.</p>

<p class='c017'>The principal difficulty of this method lies in determining
the precise moment when it can be applied. The distinction
between the healthy and the morbid is often extremely difficult
to establish. No doubt there are cases where no hesitation
is possible; but there are also debatable zones lying between
the territories of health and disease. Claude Bernard
ventured to write, “What is called the normal state is
purely a conception of the mind, a typical ideal form
entirely disengaged from the thousand divergences among
which the organism is incessantly floating, amid its alternating
and intermittent functions.” If this is the case with
regard to bodily health, we may expect to find it still more
so with regard to mental. The dilemma: Either this man
is mad or he is not, is, in many cases, says Griesinger,
meaningless. The psychical organism, being more complex
and less stable than the physical, makes it still more difficult
to fix a norm. Finally, this difficulty attains its maximum
in our subject, because the emotional—the most mobile
among all the forms of psychic life—oscillates incessantly
around one point of equilibrium, always ready to sink too
low or rise too high.</p>

<p class='c017'>As, however, it is necessary to adopt some definite
characteristics which may serve as pathological signs, as
criteria for distinguishing the healthy from the morbid in
the emotional order, we shall accept those proposed by
Féré. According to him, an emotion may be considered as
morbid—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. When its physiological concomitants present themselves
with extraordinary intensity (I think we should add, or an
extraordinary depression).</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>2. When it takes place without sufficient determining
cause.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. When its effects are unreasonably prolonged.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>These three signs, which I shall call respectively abnormal
reaction by excess or defect, disproportion (apparent) between
cause and effect, and chronicity, will frequently be of
service to us in the study of the emotions. For the moment
we are only treating of pleasure and pain.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Beginning with pleasure, I shall first examine a typical
case studied by several physiologists, who have not furnished
any, to me, satisfactory explanation. I mean the special
state which has been called “the luxury of pity” (Spencer),
pleasure in pain (Bouillier), and which it would be more
accurate to call “the pleasure of pain.” It consists in being
pleased with one’s own suffering and tasting it like a pleasure.</p>

<p class='c017'>This disposition of the mind is not, as one might think,
peculiar to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>blasé</i></span> persons and to epochs of refined civilisation;
it seems inherent in humanity the moment it emerges
from barbarism. Bouillier<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a> has quoted from the ancient
writers passages referring to it, not only in Lucretius,
Seneca, and other moralists, but in the Homeric poems,
which reflect a very primitive civilisation, yet in which a
man “rejoices in his tears.” Parallel passages might have
been found in the Bible, and also, I suppose, in the epics
of ancient India. We have not, therefore, to deal with a
rare phenomenon, though it becomes more frequent as
we advance in civilisation.</p>

<p class='c017'>A few examples will be of greater value than any opinions
I could cite. They may be found of all sorts—pleasure in
physical pain, and pleasure in moral pain. Certain patients
find intense enjoyment in irritating their sores. Mantegazza<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
says: “I knew an old man who acknowledged to
me that he found an extraordinary pleasure, and one which
seemed to him equal to any other, in scratching the inflamed
surfaces surrounding a senile sore in his leg from which he
had suffered for some years.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>A celebrated man of the Renaissance, Cardan, says in his
autobiography that “he could not do without suffering, and
when this happened to him, he felt such an impulse arise in
him, that every other pain seemed a relief.” When in this
state, he was in the habit of torturing his own body till
forced to shed tears by the pain.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a> I might enumerate a long
series of these pleasures of physical pain. Of the pleasures
of moral pain I will give but one example: melancholy in
the ordinary, non-medical sense-the melancholy of lovers,
poets, artists, etc. This state may be considered as typical
of the deliberate enjoyment of sadness. Any one may be
sad, but melancholy is not to be attained by every one. I
may mention also, in passing, the pleasures of ugliness in
æsthetics, and the taste for sanguinary spectacles and
tortures which we shall have to consider in another place.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we leave the facts and come to the explanations proposed,
we shall find that they are not numerous. Bouillier
(<i>op. cit.</i>) seems to adopt the opinion of a Cartesian, who
said, “If the soul, in all movements of the passions, even
the most painful, is in some measure tickled by a secret
feeling of pleasure, if it takes pleasure in pain, and does not
wish to be consoled, it is because of a consciousness that
the state in which it finds itself is the state of heart and
mind best suited to its situation.” I fail to understand
this pretended explanation. I prefer that of Hamilton,
who places the principal cause in the increased
activity imparted to our whole being by the sense of
our own sufferings. This, at least, is logical, since
pleasure is connected with its habitual correlative—an
increase of activity. Spencer has examined the problem
at greater length.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a> "Here I will draw attention only to
another egoistic sentiment, and I do this because of its
mysterious nature. It is a pleasurably painful sentiment,
of which it is difficult to identify the nature, and still more
difficult to trace the genesis. I refer to what is sometimes
called ‘the luxury of grief.’... It seems possible that this
sentiment, which makes a sufferer wish to be alone with
his grief, and makes him resist all distraction from it, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>arise from dwelling on the contrast between his own worth,
as he estimates it, and the treatment he has received—either
from his fellow-beings or from a power which he is
prone to think of anthropomorphically. If he feels that he
has deserved much while he has received little, and still
more if instead of good there has come evil, the consciousness
of this evil is qualified by the consciousness of worth,
made pleasurably dominant by the contrast.... There is
an idea of much withheld, and a feeling of implied superiority
to those who withhold it.... That this explanation is the
true one I feel by no means clear. I throw it out simply as
a suggestion, confessing that this peculiar emotion is one
which neither analysis nor synthesis enables me clearly to
understand."</p>

<p class='c017'>This explanation seems to me only a partial one, and not
applicable to all cases. In my opinion, no efforts of this
kind can be successful, because the authors remain on the
ground of normal psychology. This class of facts ought
to be treated by the pathological method. It may be said
that this is only the substitution of one word for another.
By no means, as we shall see by the result.</p>

<p class='c017'>The mistake lies in attacking, in the first instance,
phenomena of too delicate a nature, and considering
them as isolated facts. We must proceed, not by
synthesis or analysis, but by the cumulative method—<i>i.e.</i>,
we must establish a chain of facts, of which the last links,
being of overwhelming importance, shall throw light on the
first. I indicate the principal stages of this gradation
thus—Æsthetic melancholy (transitory and intermittent);
spleen, melancholia (in the medical sense);<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a> then, advancing
a step further, suicidal tendencies, and finally, suicide.
This last term makes all the others comprehensible. The
first stages are only embryonic, abortive, or modified forms
of the tendency to self-destruction, of the desire which
makes it seem agreeable. The weaker forms—checked in
an immense majority of cases—approximate more or less to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>destruction, and can only be explained if compared with the
extreme case.</p>

<p class='c017'>The evolutionists have stated the hypothesis that there
must have existed certain animals so constituted that, in
them, pleasure was connected with destructive acts, pain
with useful ones, and that, as every animal seeks pleasure
and shuns pain, they must have perished in virtue of their
very constitution, since they sought the destructive and
shunned the preservative influences. There is nothing
chimerical in this supposition, for we see men find pleasure
in acts which, as they very well know, will speedily result
in their deaths. A being thus constituted is abnormal,
illogical; he contains within himself a contradiction of
which he will perish.</p>

<p class='c017'>But, one may say, if pain and hurtful acts on the one
hand, pleasure and serviceable acts on the other, form indissoluble
pairs, of such a kind that the painful state in
consciousness is the equivalent of destructive acts in the
organism, and inversely, we should here have an interversion—pleasure
would express disorganisation; pain, reorganisation.
This hypothesis is not a very probable one,
and scarcely seems necessary. If we admit, as has been
said in the preceding chapter, that there always exist two
simultaneous and opposite processes whose difference is
all that is perceptible to the consciousness, it is sufficient
for one of the processes to be accelerated or the other
retarded, in an abnormal manner, in order to change the
difference in favour of one or the other. No doubt the
final result contradicts the rule, since in the above cases
the surplus which ought to be negative (pain) is positive
(pleasure). But this is a new proof that we are confronted
with a deviation, an anomaly, a pathological case to be
treated as such.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have taken by itself and studied a typical case; it now
remains, not to enumerate, but to classify pathological
pleasures in order to show their frequency. Taking as a
guide the excellent definition of Mantegazza, “Morbid
pleasure is that which is either the cause or the effect of
an evil,” I divide them into three classes.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Semi-pathological pleasures, which form the transition
from the healthy to the frankly morbid. These require an
excessive or prolonged expenditure of vital energy. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>know that the pleasures of taste, smell, sight, hearing,
touch, muscular exercise, the sexual relations, produce
fatigue and exhaustion, or even suddenly become painful.
The pleasures of affection, of self-love, of possession, when
they become passions—that is to say, when they increase
in intensity and stability—cease to be pure pleasures; a
painful element is added to them. This phenomenon is
natural and logical, since every increase in activity entails
losses, and consequently conditions of pain. This class is
scarcely morbid, since pain here <em>succeeds</em> pleasure. This is
not the case with the other two, in which pleasure rises from
the midst of destruction, and dominates the consciousness.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Pleasures destructive of the individual. I do not stop
to discuss certain anomalies of taste and smell which will
be described elsewhere; but the pleasures due to intoxication
and narcotics are so widespread that they seem
inherent in humanity. At all times, in all places, even in
the savage state, man has found artificial means of living—if
only for a moment—in an enchanted world. He has
himself created this pleasure for his own destruction. But
there are still clearer cases—of tendencies not acquired or
invented—when pleasure makes and dominates the process
of disorganisation. Thus, during a certain period of the
general paralysis of the insane, the patient believes himself
to possess the supreme degree of strength, health, riches,
and power; satisfaction and happiness are expressed in his
whole bearing. Thus in certain forms of acute mania, on
one side (which we shall pass over for the present) it shows
itself in anger; on another, in exuberant spirits, abounding
joy—a feeling of energy and vigour. Some patients say,
after their recovery, that they never felt so happy as during
their illness (Krafft-Ebing). We may also mention the case
of consumptive patients, many of whom are never so rich
in hopes or so fertile in projects as when at the point of
death. Finally, we have the sense of well-being (“euphoria”)
of the dying. It has been attempted to explain this by
analgesia, as if the suppression of pain were identical with
the appearance of joy. Féré, who has examined the question
in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Pathologie des Emotions</cite></span>,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a> concludes that this exaltation
is due to momentary but positive conditions of the cerebral
circulation.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Must we admit that, in these cases, by an inconceivable
derogation from natural determinism, pleasure becomes the
translation into consciousness of a deep and incurable
disorganisation? There is no need of this. It is more
rational to admit that this pleasure is here, as elsewhere,
connected with its natural cause, a superabundance of vital
activity. Every pathological pleasure is accompanied by
excitability; but the latter is not a normal activity, or the
fever-patient and the neuropath would enjoy an excess of
health. In reality, we are confronted with a complex case;
on the one hand, a perpetual and enormous loss, which
goes on rapidly, without becoming perceptible to the
consciousness; on the other, a superficial excitement,
which is momentary and conscious. The anomaly is in
this psychic disproportion, or rather in the short-sighted
consciousness, which cannot pass its narrow limits and
penetrate into the region of the unconscious.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. Destructive pleasures of a social character, which are
connected, not with the suffering of the individual himself,
but with that of others. Such is the pleasure felt in killing
and seeing killed—in sanguinary spectacles, bull-fights, fights
between animals, and, in a much feebler degree, in hearing
or reading tales of bloodshed. These pleasures can be
explained; they denote the satisfaction of tendencies to
violence and destruction, which, strong or weak, conscious
or unconscious, exist in all men. They may be studied
under the heading of the pathology of tendencies, which
I shall treat later on; let me only remark in passing that
these tendencies involve a certain display of energy, which
is one of the conditions of active pleasure.</p>

<p class='c017'>One question in conclusion. Can pleasure, and joy in
particular, be the cause of a grave catastrophe, such as madness
or death? Some alienists—Bucknill, Tuke, Guislain,
etc.—quote cases of madness which they attribute to sudden
joy, such as an unforeseen inheritance, or success in obtaining
a long-wished-for situation. The same thesis has been
maintained in the case of death<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a> occurring suddenly, or after
syncope. Griesinger maintains that it is extremely rare—if
it ever happens—for excessive joy <em>by itself</em> to produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>madness. Others absolutely deny the fact.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a> It is certain
that joy is seldom seen figuring in any enumeration of the
causes of madness. Joy, as a state of consciousness, could
not have such effects. The catastrophe can only be explained
by sudden and violent organic troubles, which cannot
have this effect unless there already exists a predisposition.
It is not joy which maddens or kills, but the shock received
by a being in an abnormal state. It would be more correct
to say that an event which, in the generality of men, <em>ought</em>
to cause joy, here produces a peculiar pathological state
ending in madness or death.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>

<p class='c019'>The other side of the subject may be briefly disposed of.
We occasionally, though rarely, meet with people who grieve
over good fortune when it comes to them; these have the
pain of pleasure. I do not think that any psychologist has
dwelt on them, and it seems to me useless to make a study
of these cases. Though in form the reverse of the pleasure
of pain, it fundamentally resembles it. This disposition of
mind, found in certain pessimists, is rightly called eccentric
or bizarre—<i>i.e.</i>, general opinion instinctively looks on it
as a deviation, an anomaly. This, moreover, is only a
special instance of a general state of mind—morbid or
pathologic sadness—which we are about to study. I
have remarked above that, as pain and sadness always
involve a morbid element, the expression <em>abnormal</em> would
be more accurate and less open to criticism.</p>

<p class='c017'>In order to affirm that a physical or moral pain is outside
the usual law, and may be described as abnormal, we shall
have recourse to the three distinctive marks given at the
opening of this chapter, and we can take, as our one type,
that of melancholia in the medical sense. It presents the
required characteristics: the long duration, disproportion
between the cause and effect experienced, and excessive or
insufficient reaction.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is needless to give a description of the melancholic
state; it may be found in all treatises on mental disease.
This affection assumes many clinical forms, varying from
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>melancholia attonita</i></span>, which simulates a stupid apathy, to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>agitated form accompanied by incessant groans, from the
slight to the profound and incurable forms. It will be
sufficient to enumerate the most general features. In
comparing melancholy with ordinary sadness, we may
follow the cumulative method, because the morbid state
is nothing but the normal condition thrown into high
relief.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. We know that the physiological characteristics of
normal sadness are reducible to a single formula: lowering
of the vital functions. The same is the case with melancholia,
where, however, the organic depression is much
more accentuated. Constriction of the vaso-motor nerves,
resulting in a diminished calibre of the arteries, anæmia,
and lowered temperature of the extremities; lowering
of the cardiac pressure, which may descend from an
average of 800 grammes to 650 and even 600 grammes;
a progressive slackening of nutrition, with various resultant
manifestations, such as digestive troubles, checked secretions,
etc.; slow and rare movements; a dislike of all muscular
effort, all work, all physical exercise, unless there are (as
sometimes happens in cases of agitated melancholia)
moments of disordered reflex movements and attacks of
fury. Such is the general condition. It is obvious that
this represents pain carried to an extreme degree, and that
we find, here too, as well as in normal melancholy, passive
and active pains.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The psychic characteristics consist, in the first place,
of an emotional state varying from apathetic resignation to
despair; some patients are so crushed as to think themselves
dead. It has been noted that, in general, persons of a
gloomy disposition are inclined to melancholia, while those
of a cheerful one rather tend towards mania. In both cases
there is an exaggeration of the normal condition. The
intellectual disposition consists in the slackening of the
association of ideas, in indolence of the mind. Ordinarily,
a fixed idea predominates, excluding from the
consciousness all that has no relation to it; thus the
hypochondriac thinks only of his health; the nostalgic, of
his country; the religious melancholiac, of his salvation.
Voluntary activity is almost <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span>; aboulia, “the consciousness
of not willing, is the very essence of this disease”
(Schüle). Sometimes there are violent and unexpected reflex
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>impulses, which are a new proof of the annihilation of the
will. To sum up: while normal sadness has its moments
of intermission, the melancholiac is shut up in his grief as
if by an impenetrable wall, without the slightest fissure
through which a ray of joy might reach him.</p>

<p class='c017'>Here arises a question we cannot neglect, because it is
connected with one of the principal theses of this work,
the fundamental part played by the feelings. Passive
melancholia, being taken as the type of the painful state
under its extreme and permanent form, what is its origin?
There are two possible answers. We may admit that a
physical pain, or a certain representation, engenders a
melancholic disposition, and poisons the affective life.
Or we may admit that a vague and general state of
depression and disorganisation becomes concrete and fixes
itself in an idea. On the first supposition the intellectual
state is primary, and the affective state resultant. On the
second the affective state is the first moment, and the
intellectual state results from it.</p>

<p class='c017'>This problem, rather psychical than practical, has only
occupied a very small number of alienists. Schüle admits
the twofold origin.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a> Sometimes the patient, suffering from
a painful and causeless depression, which he cannot shake
off, inquires no further; but, most frequently, he connects
the painful feeling with some incident in his previous or
present life. Sometimes, <em>much more rarely</em>, the haunting
idea is the first to appear, and forms the pivot of the melancholic
state and its consequences. Dr. Dumas,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a> who has
devoted a special work to this question, founded on his
own observation, comes to the same conclusions as Schüle.
One of his patients attributed her incurable sadness, in turn,
and without sufficient reason, to her husband, to her son, to
expected loss of work. In others, the melancholy is of
intellectual origin: the loss of fortune, the idea of irrevocable
damnation, etc. He is thus led to admit that a
melancholia of organic origin is the most frequent, one of
intellectual origin the rarest.</p>

<p class='c017'>Can we trace back these two modes of manifestation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>a common and deeper cause? This is Krafft-Ebing’s<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c010'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
solution: “We must consider psychic pain and the arrest of
ideas as co-ordinate phenomena; and there is reason to think
of a common cause, of a nutritive trouble of the brain
(anæmia?), leading to a diminished expenditure of nervous
activity. Taken comprehensively, melancholia may be considered
as a morbid condition of the psychic organism
founded on nutritive troubles, and characterised on the
one hand by the feeling of pain and a particular mode of
reaction on the part of the whole consciousness (psychic
neuralgia), on the other by the difficulty of psychic movements
(instinct, ideas), and finally, by their arrest.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I am unwilling to incur the reproach of inferring more
from facts than they contain, and of insisting on unity at
any price; but it follows from the preceding that if the
element of feeling is not everywhere and always primary,
at least it is so in the majority of cases. Besides, it is
closely connected with fundamental trophic troubles, so that
we arrive at the same conclusion by another road. Dumas
(<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 133 <i>et seq.</i>) has insisted on the depressing
influences of marshy soil, on the stagnation, the physical
and moral apathy of the inhabitants of Sologne, the
Dombes, the Maremma, and other regions infested by
<em>malaria</em>, a condition which may be summed up in two
words, sadness and resignation. These facts are quite in
favour of the organic origin of melancholia.</p>

<p class='c017'>The special study of the anomalies of pleasure and pain
is not important for itself alone. The formula generally
admitted since Aristotle, which couples pleasure with utility,
pain with what is injurious, admits of many exceptions in
practice. Perhaps the constitution of a pathological group
in the study of pleasure and pain may permit us to solve
some difficulties, to prevent the rule and the exceptions being
placed on the same plane, and unduly assimilated to one
another. We shall see that this is so in one of the following
chapters.</p>

</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Two methods of study—Affirmative thesis founded on observation,
deduction, and psycho-physics—Negative thesis:
the psychological trinity; confusion between consciousness
and introspection—Diversity of temperaments.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>Up to the present, pleasure and pain have been studied
first separately, as two perfectly distinct states, pure, by
hypothesis, from every admixture. We then examined those
singular cases where pain becomes the material or occasion
of pleasure, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>. We have still to speak of those
cases where the agreeable and the painful <em>coexist</em> in varying
proportions in the consciousness—<i>e.g.</i>, in the mountain-climber
who feels at the same time fatigue, the fear of the
precipices, the beauty of the landscape, and the pleasure of
difficulty vanquished. Nothing is more frequent than these
mixed forms; they would even be the rule if one could
admit, with certain authors, that there are no unmixed
pleasures or pains; but by their complex and composite
nature they are, in fact, emotions, and we shall come to
them again later on.</p>

<p class='c017'>The subject of this chapter is quite different. It is the
much-discussed, still unsolved, and perhaps insoluble
problem of neutral states, states of indifference, free from
any accompaniment, either pleasurable or painful. Do such
exist? Both the affirmative and negative are maintained by
good authorities; there is even a psychologist who seems to
me to have adopted each thesis in turn.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The question can only be entered on in two ways—by
observation and by argument. Let us examine the results
of these two methods.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Does the state of indifference exist as an <em>observable fact</em>?
Bain is, among contemporary writers, the principal champion
of this thesis, which has excited a lengthy discussion.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c010'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
He does not pretend to affirm that there is a single state of
feeling free from every agreeable or disagreeable element;
but if these elements only exist as infinitesimal quantities,
psychology need take no account of them. Pleasure and
pain are clearly defined generic states; yet there is a practical
interest in knowing whether any neutral conditions
exist. Bain finds the type of these in cases of simple
excitement, which may be accompanied either by pleasure
or by pain, but remain distinct from either. The sensation
of burning, the smell of asafœtida, the taste of aloes, these
are modes of excitement which we call pain, because in
them pain predominates. The noise of a mill, the confused
murmur of a great city, are modes of excitement which may
be called agreeable or disagreeable; but the excitement is
the essential fact, the pleasure and pain are accidental.</p>

<p class='c017'>Bain does not appear to me happy in most of the examples
he has chosen. I quote some of them. The shock produced
by surprise—but surprise is only a mitigated form of
fear, and in nearly all cases instantaneously assumes a
painful or pleasurable character. The state of expectation:
“The intense objectivity of one’s looks when following
a race, or a great surgical operation, is not, strictly
speaking, unconsciousness, but a maximum of energy with
a minimum of consciousness. It is rather a mode of indifference—more
of an excitement than an affective state.” Here
we may make the same comment; moreover, there is in
expectation a feeling of effort which soon becomes fatigue,
and, in most instances, expectation involves the anticipation
of some event either desired or dreaded.</p>

<p class='c017'>Those who do not attempt to prove the existence of
neutral states by direct observation deduce them from
general principles. Thus Sergi considers them as the necessary
effect of determinate biological conditions. Pleasure
and pain being the two fundamental forms—the two poles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of the life of feeling, there must exist between them a
neutral zone corresponding to a state of perfect adaptation.
Pain is a state of consciousness revealing a conflict of the
organism with exterior forces—a want of adaptation of one
to the other; whence a loss of energy. Pleasure is a state of
consciousness which makes it evident that the reaction of
the organism is connected with external excitations, whence
arises, by synergy, a heightening of vital activity. Indifference
is the neutral state of consciousness showing a
perfect adaptation of the organism to constant and variable
intensities—in other words, excitations which neither increase
nor diminish vital activity, but preserve it, produce a
state of equilibrium and appeal to the consciousness neither
as pleasure nor pain.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c010'><sup>[55]</sup></a> This hypothesis—viz., that at certain
moments the sentient being neither loses nor gains, and
that such is the substratum of the psychic state called
neutral, seems to me extremely probable, but remains no
more than a hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now let us question the psycho-physicists who have
treated this subject according to their own special method,
while coming to different conclusions. It is difficult to
adopt a procedure more theoretical than theirs, or one
better adapted to show the insufficiency of the intellectualist
method in this domain of psychology. In truth, the subject
treated by them is a special aspect of the problem, not its
totality; they are inquiring whether, in the “transformation”
of pleasure into pain, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>, there is, in the
passage from one contrary to the other, a point of neutrality
or indifference. Wundt graphically represents the phenomenon
by a curve: the portion of this curve above the line
of the abscissa has a positive value, and corresponds to the
development of pleasure; the portion below corresponds to
the development of pain, and has a negative value; the
precise point where the curve cuts the line of the abscissa (to
rise in the direction of pleasure or descend in that of pain)
corresponds to neutrality or indifference. Lehmann, who,
however, admits that weak sensations are neutral states,
gives a curve rather different from that of Wundt. From
an observation first made by Horwicz, and experiments
conducted by Lehmann himself, it appears that, if one dips
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>one’s finger into water whose temperature gradually rises
from 35° to 50° Centigrade during a space of 2 minutes and
20 seconds, one feels first an agreeable warmth, then some
slight, unpleasant prickings, then oscillations of intense
prickings with moments of rest, and lastly, pain. His
conclusion is contrary to Wundt’s, for he finds that the
passage from pleasure to pain does not take place in a
neutral state.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c010'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Experiments are not to be despised; but as for the figure
supposed to illustrate the phenomenon, it is merely misleading;
this mathematical conception explains nothing.
The assimilation of pleasure to a positive, and pain to a
negative value, is quite arbitrary. Moreover, the passage
from <em>plus</em> to <em>minus</em> quantities through zero is an operation
which has its base in our faculty of abstraction, and for
its materials abstract and homogeneous quantities. The
different degrees of pleasure and pain are nothing of this
sort. We do not even know if these two phenomena have
a common foundation, if there is a common measure
between the two, if they are not both irreducible, and we
have no right to place, theoretically, a <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Nullpunkt</i></span> at the
point of transition from one to the other. The problem is
one of a concrete order; it is a question of fact, whether
soluble or not, which is put before us.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Let us now listen to those who refuse to admit states
of indifference.</p>

<p class='c017'>Every state of consciousness is a trinity in the theological
sense: it is the knowledge of some exterior or interior
event; it includes motor elements; it has a certain tone of
feeling. We describe it as intellectual, motor, or emotional,
according to the preponderance of one of these elements,
not its exclusive existence. It is a well-known fact that the
clearer a perception, the weaker is its tone of feeling,
and the more intense an emotion, the more attenuated the
intellectual element which has evoked it; but diminution is
not equivalent to disappearance. If neutral states existed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>one of the fundamental elements of psychic life would exist
only in an intermittent form, and at some moments even
cease to be.</p>

<p class='c017'>Besides this, let us observe ourselves and interrogate our
own consciousness. “Let us consider ourselves at one of
those moments of calm and apparent indifference, when it
seems as if nothing could move us, and our numbed sensibility
remains, as it were, suspended between pleasure and
pain. This deceptive appearance of insensibility and
aridity always masks some more or less feeble sensations
of ease or uneasiness, some more or less slight and confused
sentiments of joy or grief which are none the less
real for being in nowise vivid or exciting. Moreover, how
could our sensibility fail to be, constantly, more or less
impressed by so many general causes which, independent
of particular causes, so constantly act upon us, at every
instant of our life, and which, so to speak, ceaselessly
besiege us, from within and from without?” Bouillier,
the author of this passage (<i>op. cit.</i>, chap. xi.), supports his
assertions by citing the innumerable impressions which come
from the internal organs, from the state of the air and sky,
from light, from the most trivial incidents of common life.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is certain that the domain of the indifferent states, if
existent at all, is very scanty. Yet, however skilfully
Bouillier may support his thesis, there is one irrefragable
objection to be urged against it: the testimony of the consciousness,
always doubtful, is here more so than elsewhere.
What he proposes to us is, in fact, to <em>observe</em> ourselves.
From the moment when we begin to do this, we no longer
have to deal with the natural consciousness, in its raw state,
but with that somewhat artificial consciousness which is
created by attention. We look, not with our eyes, but
through a microscope; we amplify, we enlarge the phenomenon;
and here the method of enlargement is not to
be trusted. It causes certain subconscious states to cross
the threshold of the consciousness; it makes them pass out
of the penumbra into full light, and disposes us to believe
that such is their normal condition. We know that some
individuals, by fixing the attention firmly on some particular
part of the body, can bring about in it a sensation of weight, of
irritation, of arterial pulsation, etc. Do these modifications
always exist, unperceived only so long as the attention is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>not directed to them? or does attention produce them by
means of an increased vascular activity, increasing, but not
creating? The latter supposition is the more probable.
The hypochondriac who obstinately and patiently watches
the details of his organic life feels within himself the
motion of the vital mechanism which escapes most men.
It would be easy to give other examples, proving that we
must distinguish between consciousness pure and simple
and internal observation, and that it is the less allowable
to argue from one to the other, since in practice the problem
is reduced to a difference of intensity.</p>

<p class='c017'>This question well deserves to be called, as it has been
by J. Sully, “one of the <em>cruces</em> of psychology.” Those who
wish to take sides in it can only guide their decision by
probabilities and preferences. I am inclined to favour
the thesis of indifferent states. I find it difficult to admit
that certain perceptions or representations, incessantly repeated,
imply anything more than the fact of knowledge.
The sight of my furniture, arranged in its usual order,
causes me no appreciable degree of pleasure or displeasure;
or if these exist as infinitesimal quantities, psychology,
as Bain justly says, has no concern with them. Fouillée
also points out that the feeling of indifference is not primary,
but due to an effacement.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c010'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The repugnance of certain psychologists to admit indifferent
states arises from the fact that this thesis appears
to them to introduce discontinuity into the affective life.
The mobile and incessantly alternating series of pleasurable
or painful modifications would, in that case, have moments
of interruption, gaps, and vacant spaces. I yield to no one
in asserting the continuity of the affective life; but it must
be sought elsewhere. It is in the appetites, the tendencies—conscious
or unconscious—the desires and aversions,
which, for their part, are always at work, permanent and
indestructible. Here, again, we find the mistake of considering
pleasure and pain, which are only symptoms, as
essential and fundamental elements.</p>

<p class='c017'>I find it strange, moreover, that, in a subject so much
studied and discussed, no one should have contributed an
observation which seems to me of some importance. Each
author supposes the formula adopted by himself to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>applicable to all men. This is to state the question in
a philosophical, not in a psychological form—<i>i.e.</i>, without
taking into account individual variations of temperament
and character, an element by no means to be neglected.
It is to suppose, without the least proof, that all cases are
reducible to unity. On the contrary, there are presumptions
that the solution adopted, whatever it is, may be true for
some men and false for others. A nervous, excitable temperament,
in a perpetual state of vibration, constantly kept
on the alert by the workings of passion or thought, may, by
its very constitution, leave no moment accessible to an intermission
of the incessantly renewed states of pain and pleasure.
A lymphatic temperament, on the other hand, a cold disposition,
a limited intelligence, poor in ideas, constitute a soil
perfectly suited to the frequent appearance and long continuance
of indifferent states.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c010'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>These differences, which are matter of common observation,
show the necessity of distrusting an over-simple
solution.</p>

and pain; lowering and heightening of vital energy—Féré’s
experiments—Meynert’s theory—II. Finality of
pleasure and pain—Exceptions: explicable cases; irreducible

<p class='c016'>I shall not delay long over the question, as much
debated as the one we have just quitted and still less accessible:
Which first makes its appearance in consciousness,
pleasure or pain? In our own day, especially, optimists and
pessimists have contested this point at great length, although,
in my opinion, they have no concern with it. Their doctrines
are two antithetical conceptions of the world, depending
solely on temperament and character, which could neither
be confirmed nor invalidated by the solution of this problem.
It is clear that it is a question of origin, of psychogenesis,
foreign to experimental psychology, and admitting only of
probable solutions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Descartes expressed the singular opinion that “joy was
the first passion of the soul, since it is not credible that the
soul should have been placed in the body, except when the
latter was well disposed; hence the natural result would be
joy.” Others, following theoretic views less strange in character,
maintain that, pleasure having for its cause the free
play of our activity, pain is connected with the arrest of
pleasure, and hence is posterior to it.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c010'><sup>[59]</sup></a> The majority of
writers appear to me to favour the contrary hypothesis; the
impressions of cold, of contact, the beginning of pulmonary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>respiration, etc., are cited as proving the priority of pain;
still more so, the cries of infants and of the new-born young
of animals. Yet Preyer, in two passages which have not
excited much remark, refuses all significance to the cry, and
sees in it nothing but a reflex action.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c010'><sup>[60]</sup></a> It does not seem
doubtful that psychic life, in its first or intra-uterine and
earlier extra-uterine phases may almost be reduced to a
series of pleasurable and painful impressions. Do they
resemble those of the adult? It is probable that they do;
but it must not be forgotten that to assimilate the plastic
forms of the primitive epoch to the fixed and rigid ones of
adult life is a mode of reasoning conducive to numerous
errors.</p>

<p class='c017'>Leaving aside this question of origin, it is impossible to
close the study of pleasure and pain without a summary
recapitulation of the general theories forming the philosophy
of our subject. These may be classified under two
heads: the <em>how</em> and the <em>why</em>; what are the conditions of
existence of pleasure and pain? and what is their utility?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c019'>On the first point there has been, from antiquity to the
present day, an almost universal and very rare agreement
between different schools: pleasure has, as its condition, an
increased, pain a diminished activity. I employ this vague
formula designedly, because it covers all special formulas.
Of these it would be idle to enumerate even the chief. At
bottom, in language varying according to the era and the
doctrine, all authors say the same thing, employing, according
to their cast of intellect, a metaphysical, physical
(Léon Dumont), physiological, or psychological formula.
The intellectualists themselves agree with the others;
considering sensibility as a confused form of intelligence,
they say that pleasure is a confused judgment of perfection,
and pain a confused judgment of imperfection. In short,
if each formula is stripped of the variations adapting it to
the particular philosophy of each author, there is a common
residue, which, in all alike, is the essential.</p>

<p class='c017'>The history of these variations on the same theme would
be monotonous and unprofitable; it is as well, however,
to note that, as our own century advances, the theoretic
conception of the ancients tends to grow more precise,
to rely more on the support of experience and be justified
thereby. We have already seen the two formulas—augmentation,
diminution—taking definite shape, showing themselves
in the objective and observable changes of nutrition, of
the secretions, the movements, the circulation, and the
breathing.</p>

<p class='c017'>Féré’s experiments, he says, “agree perfectly, in showing
that pleasurable sensations are accompanied by
an increase of energy, and disagreeable ones by a
diminution. The sensation of pleasure resolves itself,
therefore, into a feeling of power, that of displeasure
into a feeling of impotence. We have thus reached the
material demonstration of the theoretic ideas propounded
by Bain, Darwin, Spencer, Dumont, and others.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c010'><sup>[61]</sup></a> I may
remind the reader that Féré has applied his dynamometric
researches to all kinds of sensations: to smell, to taste, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>vision modified by glasses of the principal colours of the
spectrum, red giving a dynamometric pressure of 42, which
progressively descends to 20-17 for violet. For auditory
sensations, he finds that the dynamic equivalent is in
proportion to the amplitude and number of the vibrations.
The same results are found to follow motion, the movements
of the upper or lower limb exercising a dynamogenic
influence on the corresponding member. Still further: an
excitation <em>imperceptible to the consciousness</em>, a latent perception,
determines a dynamic effect just as much as a
conscious impression. Suggested hallucinations, agreeable
or the reverse, are equally accompanied by an increase or
diminution of pressure on the dynamometer.</p>

<p class='c017'>If the formula, “diminution of vital energy,” of which we
have found that melancholia is an extreme instance, can
give rise to no ambiguity, this is not the case with the
opposite formula; and certain authors have, for this reason,
thought—and rightly so—that it ought to be stated in
precise terms. Pleasure corresponds to an increase of
activity; but if we understand by this expression a large
quantity of work done, the pleasure would result from
a <em>diminution</em> of the potential energy of the organism, as
Léon Dumont has pointed out—<i>i.e.</i>, from an impoverishment,
which is contradicted by experience. We must
therefore understand this increase of activity in the
sense that the work done does not expend more energy
than the nutritive actions; or, to employ Grant Allen’s
formula, “Pleasure is the concomitant of the healthy action
of any or all of the organs or members supplied with
afferent cerebro-spinal nerves, to an extent not exceeding
the ordinary powers of reparation possessed by the
system.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c010'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Finally, we must remark that, if every external or internal
sensation, whatever its nature, is a transmission of movements
coming from without, a new acquisition for the
nervous system and the brain, <em>every</em> sensation ought at
first to produce at least a momentary increase of energy.
Féré, who has foreseen the possibility of this objection,
admits in all cases a primary excitement. “If there appear
to be cases in which phenomena of depression arise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>suddenly and subsist by themselves, it is only because
they have been insufficiently observed.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c010'><sup>[63]</sup></a> There would then
be a very short phase of increase, immediately masked,
according to him, by the phase of diminution. The
physiologists, as we have seen, are always inclined to
explain pain by intensity of sensation; but, if we take
into account its nature, its quality, and the susceptibility
of the nervous system to certain modes of motion received,
nothing prevents the loss being immediate.</p>

<p class='c017'>Meynert, in his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Psychiatrie</cite></span>, is the only writer who has
attempted to advance any nearer to an explanation, and to
determine the <em>mechanism</em> which produces pleasure and pain.
His hypothesis, in its principal points, is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c017'>As far as pain is concerned, his theory may be summed
up as an arrestive action of two categories of reflex movements,
motor and vascular. The painful state is the translation
into consciousness of this physiological mechanism.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. <i>Motor reflexes.</i>—Let us suppose the head of a sleeping
child to be slightly tickled. As the child’s sleep is
sound, and there is no pain, nothing takes place but a
slight withdrawal of the hand. If we suppose a slight
prick, there will be few movements, and these limited
to a small part of the body. But if we suppose some
severe pain, such as the extraction of a tooth, or a burn
extending over a large portion of the skin, the result will
be prolonged and terrible reflex movements in <em>all</em> parts
of the body, which (in our opinion) may be considered as
defensive. So much for external facts; what is taking
place internally?</p>

<p class='c017'>We know that vibrations are conducted slowly in the
grey matter (twelve times as slowly, according to Helmholtz,
as in the white). When an excitation increases, as we have
seen, the number of muscular groups set in motion, resistance
to transmission increases in the same proportion. “The
sensation of pain presupposes a reflex movement and an
arrest of nervous conduction in the grey substance of the
spinal marrow.” It is this process of inhibition, in varying
degrees, which is felt by the consciousness as pain.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. <i>Vascular reflexes.</i>—Peripheral excitation also has reflex
effects on the vaso-motor system; it produces contraction
of the spinal arteries, of the carotids, and of the cerebral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>arteries. Hence the syncope which frequently accompanies
acute pain, and the sleep (the result of anæmia) which has
more than once been recorded in the case of prisoners
undergoing torture. This constriction of the arteries produces
a chemical change, a deficit of oxygen and nutritive
elements in the cells of the cortex; the respiration of the
tissues is interfered with, and the distressed state of the
organism is psychologically rendered by pain.</p>

<p class='c017'>Conversely, the excitations contributing to the wellbeing
of the individual are accompanied by a free transmission
of nervous force, by vaso-motor dilatation, by
hyperæmia of the nervous centres, and, in the motor series,
by “aggressive movements,” such as the singing of birds,
the joyous barking of dogs, and other analogous manifestations
in the human subject.</p>

<p class='c017'>Meynert—vaguely enough, and relying for support on
the association of ideas—has applied his explanation to the
case of moral pain. It would not be difficult to adapt this
hypothesis to the different forms of vexation and sadness;
but with a more complicated mechanism. The point of
departure is no longer a perception, but a representation.
The phenomenon is no longer of peripheral, but of central
origin; so that it starts from the brain and returns to it,
or, in psychological terms, begins in a purely intellectual
state of consciousness and ends in a state that is primarily
one of feeling. If, reading by chance a list of deaths in a
newspaper, I find, with no possible opening for doubt, the
name of a friend, what takes place in me is this: the other
unknown names pass through my consciousness like empty
words, or a simple visual percept; suddenly everything is
changed; the reflex and vascular movements above described
are produced, then the arrest of the medullary and cerebral
centres, whose expression in consciousness will be grief.
But these reflex actions are only possible if the word read
suggests the recollection of former deaths, that is to say, of
a sum of privations, negations, and checked desires, the
result of a mass of accumulated experiences rising up
together and acting, whether consciously, subconsciously,
or unconsciously.</p>

<p class='c017'>An English alienist, Clouston, who has published a
critical analysis of this hypothesis of Meynert’s, considers it
as the best in the present state of the science of nervous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>physiology, although full of lacunæ, and, after all, rather
theoretical than experimental. It is not in accordance with
several facts; <i>e.g.</i>, in anger, which is a painful state, there is
an afflux of blood, combined with aggressive movements.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c010'><sup>[64]</sup></a>
On the other hand, it harmonises with a great number of
manifestations observed in mental disease; thus, at the
third stage of general paralysis, a puncture causes a painless
reflex action, because the grey substance, being disorganised,
no longer has any inhibitive power. In the evolution of
melancholia, the patients sometimes at first suffer from
purely physical pains (neuralgia, headache, etc.), which disappear
to make way for the melancholic state, which, in its
turn, disappears with the return of the physical pain.
Everyday experience shows that physical and moral pain
cannot coexist in any degree of intensity; a burn may for a
time arrest the progress of melancholy, and we all know
what happens to many persons as soon as they arrive at the
dentist’s. It seems as though the organism had but a
limited capacity for either pleasure or pain, and that neither
feeling can exist at the same time in its double (physical
and moral) form.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Much has been written on the finality of pleasure and
pain, though two entirely distinct methods of procedure
have been adopted.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first, that of theologians and moralists, is an extrinsic
explanation; pleasure is an attraction, the charm of life;
pain is a vigilant monitor warning us of our disorganisation.
They exist in us by the beneficent grace of Providence or
Nature; they have a transcendental cause.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second, which has only found complete expression in
the evolutionist school, is an intrinsic explanation. It keeps
to the analysis of facts, and shows that pleasure and pain
have their <em>why</em> in the animal’s conditions of existence, and
that consequently their causality is immanent. Thus understood,
the problem of <em>why</em> is pretty nearly identical with that
of <em>how</em>, mechanism and finality being very nearly confounded.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Herbert Spencer (followed by Grant Allen, Schneider,
and others) has clearly shown that the connection between
pleasure and utility, pain and injury, is an almost necessary
relation, having its root in the nature of things, and that
it has been an important factor in the survival of the fittest.
Every animal as a rule persists in actions which cause it
pleasure—that is, in a mode of activity which tends to its
preservation; while it usually avoids what causes it pain,
that being the correlative of injurious actions. The animal
has thus two useful guides in the course of its life, to enable
it to survive and perpetuate its species.</p>

<p class='c017'>If this rule were without exception,—if pleasure universally
accompanied utility, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>,—it would be
sufficient to state the law of the conditions of existence and
nothing more. But the exceptions to the rule are numerous,
and require critical study. Some can be explained, others
seem to me irreducible to any law.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Herbert Spencer relieves us of a large number of
exceptions, which are, in fact, only the result of civilisation.
Prehistoric man, according to this author, was well adapted
to his environment and to a predatory life; but when, under
pressure of want, the transition to a sedentary and civilised
existence took place, the human being found itself ill-adapted
to its surroundings. The conditions of social
existence have been superposed on those of natural existence,
constituting a new <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>milieu</i></span>, and requiring other forms
of activity. In consequence of this, frequent discordances
have arisen which he has enumerated at great length: the
survival of predatory tendencies difficult to satisfy, the
necessity of repugnant and monotonous labour, excess of
labour compensated for by excess of pleasure, as so frequently
happens in great cities, etc.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c010'><sup>[65]</sup></a> All these interversions
are the work of man, the result of his irrational struggle
against nature, of his will, of his artificial activities. “In
the case of mankind, there has arisen, and must long continue,
a deep and involved derangement of the natural
connections between pleasures and beneficial actions, and
between pains and detrimental actions—a derangement
which so obscures their natural connections that even the
reverse connections are supposed to obtain.” Spencer
thinks that a readjustment will take place in the long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>run; I leave this consolation—without sharing it—to the
optimists.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Besides these exceptions, due to the intercurrence of
social causes, there are others of an individual character,
which also can be explained. Certain poisons are agreeable
to the taste, and cause death; a surgical operation is painful,
but beneficial; many persons intensely enjoy a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>far niente</i></span>
which leads them to ruin; it is pleasant to live in the world
of pure fancy, but the reaction leaves one enervated and
unable to fulfil one’s daily task. Many other cases of this
kind may be met with in ordinary life. All these exceptions
to the rule are only apparent ones. Consciousness reveals
only the <em>momentary</em> phenomenon, and, within these limits,
its verdict is accurate; it expresses the processes actually
going on in the organism at the moment, as we have seen
in the euphoria of the dying; it cannot tell us what will
follow. The explanation reduces itself to Grant Allen’s
saying, “Neither pleasure nor pain is prophetic.”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c010'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>3. There are other facts which the partisans of final
causes prudently pass over in silence, and which certain
evolutionists have attempted to explain.</p>

<p class='c017'>Spencer remarks (<i>loc. cit.</i>, § 127) that, “while the individual
is young and not yet fertile, its welfare and the
welfare of the race go together; but when the reproductive
age is reached, the welfare of the individual and of the race
cease to be the same, and may be diametrically opposed....
Very frequently, among invertebrate animals, the death
of the parents is a normal result of propagation. In the
great class Insects, the species of which outnumber all
other animal species, the rule is that the male lives only
until a new generation has been begotten, and that the
female dies as soon as the eggs are deposited.” There is,
therefore, says the English author, a qualification to be
made.</p>

<p class='c017'>Schneider, in his interesting work <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Freud und Leid</cite></span>, inspired
by the transformist hypothesis and the ideas of
Spencer, gets rid of the difficulty by connecting pleasure
and pain with the conditions of existence, not of the <em>individual</em>,
but of the <em>species</em>: pleasure corresponding to
specific utility and pain to specific injury. This statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>of the problem is ingenious, but arbitrary. Pleasure
and pain are essentially subjective, individual states. They
can only assume a specific character by means of generalisation—<i>i.e.</i>,
as a conception of our minds, which has no reality
or value, except so far as abstracted from particular cases.</p>

<p class='c017'>Restricting our attention to man, and not occupying ourselves
with the antagonism between the individual and the
race, we shall find that there are cases very difficult to bring
under the law. A grain of sand in the eye, an attack of
dental neuralgia cause a degree of pain enormously out of
proportion with the amount of organic injury sustained.
On the other hand, the dissolution of certain organs
essential to life is frequently almost painless. The brain
may be cut and cauterised almost without suffering; a
cavity may be formed in the lung, a cancer in the liver,
without the slightest warning of danger. Pain, that
“vigilant sentinel” of the advocates of final causes, remains
dumb, or only warns us when the evil is already
of long standing and irremediable. Nay, more, it often
misleads us as to the actual seat of the disease. Examples
of false localisation abound; an irritation in the nose is due
to intestinal worms, a headache to a morbid condition of the
stomach, a pain in the right shoulder to liver complaint.
Many other instances of this kind have been studied by
physicians under the names of painful synæsthesia, or
synalgia.</p>

<p class='c017'>Schneider is, I believe, the only one who has attempted
to explain these deviations from the generally admitted
formula,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c010'><sup>[67]</sup></a> by reducing the problem to the two following
questions:—First, whether the development of an acute
sensibility of the internal organs—<i>i.e.</i>, a relation of causality
between their lesions and the feeling of pain—is, in general,
possible; secondly, whether, such development having
taken place, this faculty of feeling, as pain, any lesion of the
internal organs could be a means of protection, as it is
found to be in the case of the skin. The internal organs
are only in contact with an interior surface, which is tolerably
uniform; if an opposite state of things arises, <i>i.e.</i>, if they
are laid bare by some profound lesion, death ordinarily
ensues, at least in animals and in primitive man. Only the
slow progress of surgery has made it possible to remedy such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>accidents. If, through spontaneous variation, a case of
sensibility of the internal organs had ever occurred, it would
be useless; it could neither become permanent nor be
transmitted to descendants, since the lesion, resulting in
death, would render the further evolution of this quality
impossible. Besides, had this sensitive faculty of the internal
organs existed, it must have remained useless, since
it could only become efficacious when combined with
protective and retractile movements of the organs, which,
by the very constitution of the animal, cannot take place.
In fact, the whole of the sensibility has been concentrated
in the exterior parts of the body, which, by protecting
themselves, also protect, in the degree to which this is
possible, the internal organs.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have insisted on the exceptions (certainly they are
not without a cause, whether we accept that alleged by
Schneider, or prefer those of other authorities), because
they are only too readily forgotten. The connection of
pleasure and utility, pain and injury, is a formula which
originated with the philosophers—that is, with intellects
which always, and before all things, demand unity. Psychology
must proceed otherwise, must incessantly confront
the formula with facts, check it by experience, note the
exceptions; it is content with empirical laws, embracing the
generality, but never the totality of cases.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>In entering on the subject indicated by the title of this
chapter, we pass from the general manifestations of feeling
(pleasures and pains) to its special manifestations; we
descend from the surface to the deeper strata, in order to
arrive at the fundamental and irreducible fact at the root
of all emotion: attraction or repulsion, desire or aversion,
in short, motion, or arrest of motion.</p>

<p class='c017'>Already, in the Introduction, we have marked the place
of emotion in the development of the life of the feelings,
and, later on, in the second part of this book, we shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>examine separately each of the primitive emotions, with its
special determining characters. For the moment, we have
only to do with the general characters common to all
emotions.</p>

<p class='c017'>This term, in the language of contemporary psychology,
has replaced the words “passions,” “affections of the soul”
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>passiones</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>affectus animi</i></span>), in use during the seventeenth
century. Besides being consecrated by use, it has the
advantage of emphasising the motor element included in
every emotion (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>motus</i></span>, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Gemütsbewegung</i></span>). Maudsley says
that this word is an induction, summing up the experience
of the human race, and the term “commotion,” formerly used
to designate the same phenomena, expresses the fact still
more clearly.</p>

<p class='c017'>At first sight, and without entering into any analysis, every
emotion, even of slight intensity, appears to us as affecting
the entire individual, and expressing, in its complete form,
what Bain has called the law of diffusion. Its external
symptoms are movements of the face, the trunk, and the
limbs; its internal, numerous organic modifications caused
and dominated by the circulation—the organic function <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par
excellence</i></span>. The experiments of Lombard, Broca, Bert, Gley,
Mosso, Tanzi, etc., have shown that any and every form of
mental activity is connected with an increase in the circulation;
but the latter is always above the average when an
emotion is manifested. Emotional activity of a given
kind, says Lombard, produces an increase of temperature in
all parts of the body; it is, in general, more rapid and
stronger than that which comes from intellectual activity.
Mosso, who, by some well-known experiments, has been
enabled to study even the slightest modifications of the
circulation, concludes that “the action of the emotions on
the cerebral circulation is much more evident than that of
intellectual work, whatever its energy.” Emotion not only
presents these vague and different characteristics, but every
separate emotion is a complexus. Let us take the simplest
and commonest—fear, anger, tenderness, sexual love; each
one of them is a complete state in itself, a psycho-physiological
fascicule constituted by a grouping of simple
elements, differing with each emotion, but always
comprising a particular state of consciousness, particular
modifications of the functions of organic life, movements or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>tendencies to movement, arrest or tendencies to the
arrest of particular movements. Every primary emotion
is an innate complexus expressing directly the constitution
of the individual; the emotions are <em>organised</em>
manifestations of the life of the feelings; they are the
reactions of the individual on everything which touches the
course of his life, or his amelioration, his being, or his better
being. In a certain manner, the primary emotions are
analogous to the perceptions, which require a psycho-physiological
organism adapted to a special function in
relation to the external world; with this difference, that
sight, hearing, smell, etc., have their own special and
inalienable organs, while fear, anger, etc., have a diffused
organism, the elements of which, combined in another
manner, become the organism of another emotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>It follows that the study of the emotions, from the point
of view of pure psychology, can come to no definite conclusion.
Internal observation, however subtle, can only
describe the internal fact and note its gradations; regarding
the conditions and the genesis of emotion, it can give no
answer; it can only seize a bodiless emotion, an abstraction.
There is no manifestation of psychic life, not
excepting the perceptions, which depends more immediately
on biological conditions. The great merit of James and
Lange is that both of them, simultaneously and independently,
have demonstrated the capital importance of
physiological factors in emotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is not my intention to explain at length the thesis of
these two authors, though it is the most important contribution
made to the psychology of the emotions for some
time. It is becoming very well known, and, in any case,
is easily accessible.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c010'><sup>[68]</sup></a> Reduced to its essence, it may be
summed up in two principal propositions:—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Emotion is only the consciousness of all the organic
phenomena (external and internal) which accompany it, and
are usually considered as its effects; in other words, that
which common sense treats as the effect of emotion is its
cause.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>2. One emotion differs from another according to the
quantity and quality of these organic states and their
various combinations, being only the subjective expression
of these different modes of grouping.</p>

<p class='c017'>In order to treat a subject scientifically, says Lange, we
must fix our attention on objective marks; the study of
colours only became scientific on the day when Newton
discovered an objective character—the difference of refrangibility
in coloured rays. Let us do the same with the
emotions, for we shall find it possible. Each one of them
shows itself by gestures, attitudes, organic phenomena,
which are often, though very erroneously, considered
secondary, accessory, consecutive. Let us study them,
and so substitute for introspection an objective process
of research. As it is best to begin with simple things, the
author has confined himself “to some of the most definite
and best characterised emotions: joy, fear, sorrow, anger,
timidity, expectation,” and abstained from considering
“those in which the physical facts were not very marked,
and not easily accessible.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This is followed by a minute description of the emotions
already enumerated, and their physical symptoms, for
which I refer the reader to the work itself. If we generalise,
we shall see that the phenomena described can be classed
in two groups—(1) modifications of muscular innervation:
it diminishes in fear or sorrow, but increases in joy, anger,
impatience; (2) vaso-motor modifications: constriction in
fear and sadness, dilatation in joy and anger. Are these
two groups of equal importance?—are they both primary?
or is one subordinated to the other? As far as the actual
state of our knowledge permits us to answer the question,
says Lange, the vascular changes must be assumed as
primary, since the slightest circulatory variations profoundly
modify the functions of the brain and spinal
marrow.</p>

<p class='c017'>What is the significance of all this as regards the
emotions? According to the current psychology, an
emotional state subjected to analysis yields the following
result:—(1) an intellectual state, perception, or idea, as a
starting-point (<i>e.g.</i>, a piece of bad news, a terrifying apparition,
an injury received); (2) a state of feeling—the
emotion: sorrow, anger, fear; (3) the organic states and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>movements resulting from this emotion. But the second
point—the emotion conceived as such—is only an abstract
entity, a mere hypothesis. Now, to be admissible, a
hypothesis ought to explain all the facts and be necessary
to their explanation. This is not the case here.
We find, both in normal and in pathological life, emotions
which are derived from no ideas, but, on the contrary,
engender them: wine gives rise to joy, alcohol to courage;
ipecacuanha causes a depression akin to fear, haschisch produces
exaltation, and shower-baths calm it. Asylums are
full of patients whose irritability, melancholy, and anguish
are “causeless”—<i>i.e.</i>, result from no perception or image.
Here, we seize the true cause at its source; it lies in the
physical influences. Let us therefore get rid of the useless
hypothesis of a psychic entity called emotion, supposed
to be intercalated between the perception or idea, and
the physiological occurrences. Reversing the order admitted
by common sense, we say: First an intellectual
state, then organic and motor disturbances, and then the
consciousness of these disturbances, which is the psychic
state we call emotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>W. James, in another way, and with other arguments,
maintains the same thesis: “The bodily changes follow
directly the <em>perception</em> of the exciting fact, and our feeling
of the same changes as they occur <em>is</em> the emotion.” Reversing
what is usually accepted as common sense, we must say
that it is because we weep that we are sad, because we strike
that we feel anger, because we tremble that we are afraid.
In fear, suppress the palpitation of the heart, the hurrying
breath, the trembling of the limbs, the widening of the
muscles, the peculiar state of the viscera; in anger, the
heaving of the chest, the congestion of the face, the dilatation
of the nostrils, the clenching of the teeth, the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>staccato</i></span>
voice, the impulsive tendencies; in sorrow, get rid of tears,
sighs, sobs, suffocation, anguish—what will remain?—a
purely intellectual state, pale, colourless, cold. A disembodied
emotion is a non-existent one.</p>

<p class='c017'>This, no doubt, is a hypothesis without decisive proof.
The <em>crucial</em> experiment could only be furnished by a man
affected by total anæsthesia, external and internal, but without
paralysis. Could such an one still experience any
emotion? The case is absolutely unrealisable; James has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>only been able to find three individuals at all approaching
it—one of whom (Strümpell’s case) is well known: the
subjects are apathetic, but the emotional life is not entirely
absent; Strümpell had on several occasions noted surprise,
fear, and anger.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c010'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>We shall have to give up all hope of a positive and
decisive experiment. The thesis in itself has so paradoxical
a character that many objections may be raised against it.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Are there any real proofs that certain perceptions
produce, by immediate physical influence, corporeal effects
preceding the appearance of emotion? Assuredly. The
reading of a poem—the recital of heroic deeds—music—may
instantaneously cause a shudder of the whole body,
cardiac palpitations, tears. If you scrape one piece of
steel against another the whole nervous system is exasperated.
Is it not well known that the mere sight of blood will cause
syncope in certain persons? Finally, James alleges the
pathological cases mentioned above by Lange, where “emotion
is without object”—<i>i.e.</i>, evidently dependent on a
purely physical cause.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. If the theory is true, we ought to be able to awaken
the emotion itself, by voluntarily producing the manifestations
of a special emotion. In the majority of cases,
this criterion is inapplicable, for the majority of the organic
phenomena manifesting emotion cannot be produced at
will; the experiment therefore remains a partial one. However,
so far as it is possible, it rather corroborates than
invalidates the hypothesis. If you remain seated for a long
time in a melancholy attitude, you will be overcome by sadness.
If you are sad assume a cheerful attitude, join a
merry company, and you will gradually leave your sadness
behind. It is objected that many actors, while playing
their parts, present the perfect appearance of an emotion
which they do not feel. James gives the results of a remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>census taken in America on this point; the answers do
not all agree, some saying that they act with the brain, others
with the heart; some feel the emotions of the character,
others do not. I think that James might have mentioned
what takes place with certain hypnotised subjects; if their
limbs are placed in the attitude of prayer, anger, menace,
or affection (which amounts to a suggestion conveyed by
the muscular sense), the corresponding emotion is produced.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The manifestation of an emotion, instead of increasing,
causes it to disappear; thus, a violent burst of tears
relieves sorrow. This objection does not discriminate
between the feelings <em>during</em> the manifestation and those <em>after</em>
it. Emotion is always experienced while the manifestation
persists; but, when the nervous centres are exhausted, calm
naturally follows. Is it not said of certain men that they
would feel more if they were less “demonstrative”? This
is because the exuberance of their mode of expression
rapidly exhausts them, and does not permit the emotion to
be a lasting one, while a bilious temperament, which does
not spend itself, remains like a quiescent volcano.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have only quoted from James and Lange what was
strictly necessary in order to understand their theory. I
declare my acceptance of it in the main, but without
admitting the dualist position which they seem to have
adopted. I shall explain myself on this point in subsequent
parts of this chapter; for the moment, we have to show that
the physiological theory applies to the whole region of the
emotions.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>We have seen, in fact, that Lange expressly confines himself
to some simple emotions, and refuses to venture further.
W. James concentrates his efforts on the “coarse emotions,”
the others (“the subtler emotions”) he only refers to in
passing, limiting himself to some remarks on æsthetic emotion.
However, I think it necessary to treat this subject otherwise
than by merely passing it by. Indeed, the very numerous
advocates of the opposite view have maintained that the
physiological theory, while it may be accepted, for want
of a better, for the inferior forms of emotion, becomes insufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>as we rise to the higher, and that every attempt
to apply it to the superior forms would result in failure.</p>

<p class='c017'>We must first come to a clear understanding of the value
of the terms inferior and superior, coarse and subtle; they
can only denote degrees in evolution. The inferior or
coarse emotions have also been called “animal,” because
common to man and the greater number of animals. The
superior or subtle emotions are properly “human,” though
their germs are to be found in the higher animals.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first are connected with sensations and perceptions,
or with their immediate representations; they are in close
and direct relation with the preservation of the individual or
the species. The second are connected with images of a
less and less concrete character, or with concepts; they are
related in a more vague and indirect manner to the conditions
of existence of the individual or the species.</p>

<p class='c017'>We may also say that “inferior” is synonymous with
“primary, simple”; “superior” with “derivative, complex.”
How is the transition from inferior to superior forms produced?
For the moment, it is of no importance to know—it
is sufficient to observe that it has taken place.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c010'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Thus, just as, in the intellectual order, there is an
ascending scale, leading from the concrete, successively, to
the lower, medium, and higher forms of abstraction, so in
the affective order there is a scale ascending from fear or
anger to the most ideal emotions. And in the same way
as the highest conception retains the characteristics of the
concrete whence it sprang, on pain of being merely an
empty word, so the most ethereal sentiments cannot
entirely lose the characters which constitute them emotions,
on pain of disappearing as such.</p>

<p class='c017'>I shall not insist on these theoretic remarks; the direct
observation of facts is preferable, and gives a clearer answer.</p>

<p class='c017'>The superior and truly human forms of emotion are
reducible to four principal groups: the religious, moral, æsthetic,
and intellectual sentiments. Although the somatic
characters accompanying each of these will be noted with
the greatest care in the second part of this work, it will be
necessary, even at present, to enumerate the principal in
advance. We must more especially be on our guard
against the common error which insists in seeking emotion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>where nothing remains of it save a mere survival and
shadow. If, <i>e.g.</i>, we take the most intellectualised forms of
the religious or the æsthetic sentiment, we shall have much
trouble in recovering the physiological conditions of its
existence. There is nothing surprising in this, all we have
in this case being an abstract or extract of emotion, a
simple mark, an emotional scheme, an affective substitute
equivalent to those intellectual substitutes which take the
place of the concrete. What we must study is true
emotion, felt and expressed, not inadequately recalled to
memory, a pale remnant of what once was an emotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The religious sentiment is attached—perhaps more
than any other—to physiological conditions, because closely
connected with the instinct of self-preservation, with the
saving of the soul, under whatever form the believer may
conceive it. The <em>intensity</em> of the emotion alone is what
concerns us; its quality is a matter for critical appreciation.
We take the observable fact in the rough, whether legitimate
or not. Now, does not the believer, whatever his degree of
culture, whatever his religion, at the moment when he feels
the emotion, tremble, turn pale, exhibit the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sacer horror</i></span>, the
overwhelming awe which may end in unconsciousness, the
prostrate attitude? Have not the mystics over and over
again described the violent disturbances which agitate
them, the internal tempest which ravages them, till, calm
being re-established, they express themselves in language
frequently recalling that of sexual love? The designation
“hysterical,” bestowed, rightly or wrongly, on many of
them, is based on the physical symptoms described by
themselves. And have not the methods employed to
excite, revive, or strengthen religious emotion, from the wine
of the ancient Bacchanals to the noisy concerts of the
Salvation Army, a direct physiological influence on the
organs? What of the action of the rites which are only
the fixed expression of a particular form of belief? and
the miracles which happen in all religions to those who
have “the faith which saves”—do they not take place in
the organism? We might fill many pages with the mere
enumeration of the material conditions surrounding, sustaining,
evoking the religious sentiment, as we find it <em>in fact</em>
in contemporary life, or in history. Nothing is more
chimerical than to conceive religious emotion as an unmixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>act, a psychological entity existing in and by itself, independently
of its physiological concomitants. Suppress all these,
and what remains?—a pure idea, cold and colourless. It
is very evident that the physiological factors which show
themselves so vividly in intense emotion, are attenuated by
the effect of temperament, of repetition, and of custom;
but in the same measure also, emotion is enfeebled and
attenuated; a lofty religious <em>conception</em> and a profound
religious <em>emotion</em> are two exceedingly different psychical
phenomena. We shall come back to this point later on.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Moral emotion, also, must not be confounded with the
moral idea. The abstract notion of justice, duty, categoric
imperative, acts on some, and is without influence on
others. Moral emotion, not factitious and conventional,
but really felt and experienced, is a shock and an impulse
that carries one away; it always shows itself by internal and
external movements; it acts like an instinct. Sympathy,
which places us in unison with others, making us feel their
happiness and misery, is (as we shall see later) a property of
animal life which imperatively requires physiological conditions,
and cannot exist without them; now the part
played by sympathy in the genesis of the moral emotions is
quite clear. Is not the man who runs to arrest a thief or a
murderer, being merely a witness, and not himself robbed
or assaulted, subjected to a disturbance which is really
physiological? In explosions of maternal love, in acts of
sudden self-devotion, is there not a <em>raptus</em> which shakes the
whole individual from head to foot? If these facts, among
so many others, are not sufficient, let us consider what
takes place in masses of people under strong excitement,
in certain cases of the psychology of crowds. “If into the
term morality we import the momentary appearance of
certain qualities, such as abnegation, devotion, disinterestedness,
self-sacrifice, the sense of justice, we may say
that crowds are sometimes accessible to a very lofty morality
... a much loftier one, indeed, than that of which the
isolated individual is capable. Only collectively is humanity
capable of great acts of disinterestedness and devotion.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c010'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
But in this state of enormously magnified moral emotion, is
it conceivable that the physiological factors are negligible?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Are they not the natural and necessary vehicles of moral
contagion?</p>

<p class='c017'>3. I shall be very brief in treating of intellectual emotion,
since it is rare, and usually temperate in character; however,
when it springs up with the true characteristics of intense
emotion, it does not deviate from the rule. Most human
beings are not passionately eager for the search after or the
discovery of pure truth, any more than they are afflicted
by privation of it; but those possessed by this demon are
given up to him, body and soul. Their emotion is no
more independent of physiological conditions than any other.
The biographies of learned men furnish us with innumerable
examples: the perpetual physical sufferings of Pascal,
Malebranche nearly suffocated by the palpitations of his
heart when reading Descartes, Humphrey Davy dancing
in his laboratory after having made the discovery of
potassium, Hamilton suddenly feeling something “like the
closing of a galvanic circuit” at the moment of discovering
the method of quaternions, etc. There is no need to extend
our search so far; everyday life provides us moment by
moment with examples which, though prosaic, are none the
less valuable as proofs. The instinct of curiosity is at the
root of all intellectual emotion, whether lofty or commonplace.
Does not the man who perpetually watches his
neighbour’s conduct and the thousand petty details of his
life, feel when his puerile curiosity is baffled, all the physical
anguish of unsatisfied desire?</p>

<p class='c017'>4. If we are to believe certain over-subtle critics, æsthetic
emotion would have the privilege of moving in the region of
pure contemplation. This assertion is founded on the
error pointed out above, which consists in taking into
account only the <em>quality</em> of the emotion, not its intensity.
They put a critical emotion, purified, sublimated, stripped
as far as possible of its somatic resonance, in the place
of the true, primitive emotion, whence all the others
have issued, and which they, like the rest of men, have
begun by experiencing; for even the most refined cannot
begin at the end. It is an abstract mode of feeling substituted
for the concrete. W. James makes, on this point,
some excellent remarks, to which we refer the reader (<i>op. cit.</i>,
pp. 428 <i>et seq.</i>). Complete æsthetic emotion, without regard
to its quality, does not always require advanced culture.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The savage who, along with his companions, excites
himself over his dance and song, becomes intoxicated
with sound and motion; the naïve spectator quite carried
away by the interest of a crude melodrama; the Spanish
peasant, contemplating his church crammed with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>rococo</i></span>
ornaments and strangely-dressed saints: all these experience
the concrete emotion which shakes the frame, makes the
heart beat, produces tears, laughter, or gestures.</p>

<p class='c017'>Besides, it is enough to recall the researches inaugurated
by Fechner in his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Vorschule der Æsthetik</cite></span>, and since continued,
especially in Germany, under the name of elementary
æsthetics,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c010'><sup>[72]</sup></a> which so greatly emphasise the part played
by the sensory element in the genesis of æsthetic pleasure
and pain. We may thus briefly summarise them: There
are two constituent factors in the æsthetic sentiment—one
direct, connected with sensations and perceptions; the
other indirect, connected with representations (images and
associations of ideas). One or the other predominates,
according to the particular art: the direct factor in music
and the plastic arts, the indirect in poetry. The direct
factor, by its very definition, depends on the organism.
The colours are not simple sensations, they have an affective
tone proper to themselves. According to Wundt,
white suggests gaiety; green, a quiet joy; while red corresponds
to energy, strength, etc. We may or may not admit
these correspondences; Scripture gives others, and they probably
vary from one individual to another; but the principle
is unassailable. Féré’s previously quoted experiments, on
exciting and depressing colours, tend in the same direction.
It is the same with sounds:—according as they are high,
deep, or medium, they induce a special mood. If from
simple sensation we pass to perceptions, direct physical
action is not doubtful; we find it in the arrangement of
colours, in the phenomena of contrasts, in the outlines and
forms of certain lines, in the innate pleasure of symmetry
and regularity, in rhythm, measure, cadence, in the perception
of harmony and dissonance, etc. In truth, the authors
cited, have insisted rather on the sensory action than on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>organic and motor modifications accompanying it. But it
always remains indisputable that the æsthetic sentiment is
necessarily connected with physiological conditions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Since we are maintaining the proposition that the intensity
of even the superior emotions is in direct ratio to the
quantity of the physiological occurrences accompanying
them, I propose in the following paragraphs to examine a
single one separately, and in some detail.</p>

<p class='c017'>Which is the most emotional of all arts? Music. There
is no possible doubt as to the answer—eliminating, of
course, those persons on whom it has no effect, and who
must be rejected for the purposes of this argument. No
art has a deeper power of penetration, no other can render
shades of feeling so delicate as to escape every other medium
of expression. So much is unanimously admitted.</p>

<p class='c017'>Is the most emotional art also—as required by our
thesis—the most dependent on physiological conditions?
Yes, and if we wish to demonstrate this, facts are so numerous
that the only difficulty is to choose between them. Let
us leave aside every intellectual element, all representations,
either vague or distinct, evoked by music; let us, further,
avoid all metaphysical dissertations on its nature and its
revelation of the Infinite, or its origin in the human species,
in order to confine ourselves to its physical and affective
aspect, and to grasp the connection.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the first place, we shall find that music has an effect
on many animals. Although on this point many nursery
tales and marvellous anecdotes have been handed down
from antiquity, yet—having made deduction of all apocryphal
stories—we find a large number of observations and experiments
which must be considered accurate. They are
to be found in the writings of various musicians or historians
of music (Grétry, Fétis, etc.). Dogs, cats, horses, lizards,
serpents, spiders, not to mention many birds, are the
examples most frequently quoted. Experiments made at
the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, particularly on the elephants,
at the beginning of this century, have been many times
referred to, and are both varied and conclusive.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c010'><sup>[73]</sup></a> Are we
to conclude from them that these animals are melomaniacs?
Some authors appear to have no doubt on this point, having
a natural inclination to neglect the physical side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>phenomenon, and to interpret it in a quasi-human sense.
It is much more probable that the sensations of sound and
movement (animals being very sensitive to rhythm) act
directly on the organism, and indirectly on the vital
functions, and produce a physical state of pleasure or pain;
perhaps in the highest, such as the elephant, a certain
affective state approximating to emotion. In short, music
acts like a burn, like heat, cold, or a caressing contact.
I have on this point consulted writers of recognised competence
in musical psychology. M. Dauriac writes to me:
“Relative consonances and dissonances, composed of major
or minor thirds, produce pleasurable or painful effects on
the organism, independently of any impression or æsthetic
judgment.” M. Stumpf has been kind enough to reply by
a long letter, amply furnished with quotations from original
authorities, whence he concludes that <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“der Grund hiervon
dürfte ein rein physiologischer sein.”</span></p>

<p class='c017'>Let us turn to primitive man. The question becomes
less simple; but the physical element still preponderates.
Music consists only of rhythm, marked by clumsy and
noisy instruments, whose principal effect is to increase the
vibration of the nervous system. The aborigines of America
are able, during four consecutive hours, to intoxicate themselves
with rhythmic sounds having no melodic significance.
Among certain tribes, diviners and sorcerers employ the
drum in order to produce in themselves a sort of ecstasy;<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c010'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
it is a true intoxication through sound, and especially
through motion—<i>i.e.</i>, an affective state excited directly by
external and internal sensations. We have here before us
the genesis of emotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>Civilised man, exceptions apart, is sensitive to music
in different degrees, from the peasant or artisan, who,
like the savage, prefers tunes with a well-marked rhythm, to
the most cultivated amateur. But for all states the primary
effect is a physical one. “Musical vibration is only one
particular mode of perceiving that universal vibration—that
music of life which animates all beings and all bodies,
from the lowest to the highest. From this point of view,
musical art may be called the art of sensibility <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span>,
since it regulates the great phenomenon of vibration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>into which all external perceptions resolve themselves,
and transfers it from the region of the unconscious,
in which it was hidden, to that of consciousness.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c010'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
Music acts on the muscular system, on the circulation, the
respiration, and the parts dependent on them. Intense
sounds (the big drum, kettledrum, etc.) give the whole
body a shock, over-acute sounds cause muscular contractions.
I know a musician who is thrown into convulsions
by too marked a discord. Let us add to these the well-known
effects of horripilation, of thrills passing down the
back or over the scalp, of sudden sweats, of tickling, of
epigastric constriction. Grétry had already noted that the
pulse is sensitive to rhythm; and he has recorded several
observations made on himself, showing that the pulsations
are accelerated or retarded according to the rhythm of a
chant heard internally. It would be an interminable task
to enumerate the purely physical effects of the musical
impression. The conclusion to be drawn is, that while
certain arts at once awaken ideas which give a determination
to the feelings, this of music acts inversely. It creates
dispositions depending on the organic state and on nervous
activity, which we translate by the vague terms—joy, sadness,
tenderness, serenity, tranquillity, uneasiness. On this
canvas the intellect embroiders its designs at pleasure,
varying according to individual peculiarities.</p>

<p class='c017'>We might go further, and pass from the general to the
particular. If music, by its effect on the organism, creates
dispositions, momentary affective situations, the differences
in voice, instrument, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>timbre</i></span>, must produce different and
special dispositions, which is indisputable. The tonality of
a piece must act in the same way, which is also admitted
by many composers. It is true that they are not agreed on
the definition and the significance of every tone, and that many
amusing discrepancies might be selected from their writings.
(So the key of E flat minor, which, for Gevaert, is powerful
and majestic, indicates, according to Grétry, an imminent
catastrophe.) Here, more than elsewhere, over-precise
definition is injurious.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let me add a remark on the therapeutic action of music.
We have abundant evidence that this was known in the
most ancient times. From the Greek physicians to Leuret,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>who employed it in his moral treatment of insanity, a long
series of cures have been attributed to it. A well-known
Russian physiologist, Tarchanoff, has recently lauded and
recommended its rational employment in disorders of the
nervous system; but it does not act through occult, mysterious,
spiritual influences; it acts physically, as a kind of
vibratory medicine. The <a id='corr106.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='reseaches'>researches</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_106.7'><ins class='correction' title='reseaches'>researches</ins></a></span> of Boudet de Paris,
Mortimer Granville, Buccola, Morselli, Vigouroux, furnish
proofs of this.</p>

<p class='c017'>Although we might say much more on this subject, the
above will be sufficient to show that the most emotional of
the arts is also that most intimately dependent on the
modifications of the organism. This has seemed to me an
argument not to be neglected in favour of the physiological
theory of emotion.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c010'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>

<p class='c019'>We have just shown that the so-called higher forms of
emotion do not escape from the necessity of physiological
conditions; but there is yet another question, still in
obscurity and suspense, which, by reason of its importance,
ought to be elucidated. It is this: Why have
certain internal or external states, certain images, certain
ideas, the privilege of exciting certain organic and motor
states, and, in consequence, emotion? How is this connection,
this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nexus</i></span>, established? for experience teaches us
that it is not necessary: in the same individual the same
perception or idea may awaken an emotion, whereas in
another case it may produce nothing. In other words, there
are perceptions, images, and concepts which remain purely
intellectual states without affective accompaniment, at least
with none accessible to consciousness. There are others
which are immediately enveloped and, as it were, submerged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in the emotion which they produce. Let us note
that the question comes before us, whatever opinion we
may adopt as to the genesis of emotion. As usually
accepted, the order is this: intellectual state, affective
state, organic states. According to the physiological
hypothesis, the order is as follows: intellectual state,
organic states, affective state. Passing from one thesis to
the other, the problem is subject to but one variation: Why
is a certain intellectual state sometimes coupled with an
intellectual state, and sometimes not? This is on the first
hypothesis. Why is a certain intellectual state sometimes
accompanied by organic and motor modifications, sometimes
not? This is on the second hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c017'>The answer is the same in both cases: the intellectual
state is accompanied by an affective state whenever there is
a direct relation with the conditions of existence, natural or
social, of the individual. In order to justify this proposition
we must examine in succession these two forms of the conditions
of existence.</p>

<p class='c017'>1st Period.—<i>Sensations or images connected with the natural
conditions of existence.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>We have here to do with a question of genesis; we
must therefore begin with the humblest phenomena. The
primordial sense, the only one in certain animals, is touch
combined with internal sensations. Let us remark that, in
its origin, the “knowledge” which we take in its lowest
degree has only a <em>practical</em> value; sensation is a monitor,
an aid, an instrument, a weapon with only one aim—the
preservation of the individual,—and completely subordinated
to that end; otherwise, it is nothing but a
useless manifestation, a luxury. The <em>nexus</em> between the
sensations and the organic and motor reactions is therefore
innate—<i>i.e.</i>, it results from the very constitution of the
animal. If it fails, the conditions of existence are at fault.
The primordial tissue, says Spencer, must be differently
affected, according as it is in contact with nutritive matter
(ordinarily soluble) or with innutritive matter (ordinarily
insoluble). The contraction by which the tactual surface
of a rhizopod absorbs a fragment of assimilable matter is
caused by a commencing absorption of this matter, <i>i.e.</i>,
contact and absorption are the same thing. The action of
certain agents is followed by a retractile movement, or, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the contrary, by movements of a character to assure the
continuance of the impression. These two kinds of movement
are, in this writer’s view, respectively the phenomena
and the signs of pleasure and pain. The tissue, therefore,
acts in such a manner as to assure pleasure and avoid
pain, by a law as physical and natural as that by which a
magnet turns towards the pole, or a tree to the light.
Without inquiring whether pleasure and pain exist in this
case—a purely hypothetical assumption—there are, at
least, objective phenomena denoting a <em>nexus</em> of utility
between the sensation and the expansive or retractile
movements.</p>

<p class='c017'>Passing from these inferior organisms to those provided
with several senses, we find no change. Each order
of sensation acts in the same way. The animal is
better informed, and consequently better protected and
armed—that is all. Finally, when certain images (<i>i.e.</i>,
recollections of pleasures and pains experienced) excite an
emotional state, the mechanism remains the same, and
tends towards the same end. It is therefore not without
reason that we have above assimilated every form of primary
emotion to a psycho-physiological organism adapted to a
particular end.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is needless to review the primary emotions and to
show that the sensation, the perception, or the image only
produces organic or motor troubles when the preservation
of the individual or the species is at stake. The intellectual
state (sensation, perception, or image) can instinctively—<i>i.e.</i>,
through an innate mechanism—produce immobility,
oppression, withdrawing into one’s self, flight (fear); or, on
the contrary, aggressive movements, attack (anger), or
movements of attraction, accompanied by phenomena
peculiar to each species (sexual love).</p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up, every event of this kind, reduced to its
simplest expression, consists in (1) an intellectual fact,
analogous to a spring moving the whole machine, (2) an
unconscious, half-conscious, or conscious reaction of the
instinct of self-preservation; this being by no means an
entity, as we have already said, but the organism itself
under its dynamic aspect.</p>

<p class='c017'>2nd Period.—<i>Perceptions, images, or ideas connected with
social conditions of existence.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Up to the present, we have only considered emotional
reaction in its relations with nature—<i>i.e.</i>, with the physical
environment. Its domain is much more extensive; in man,
and in many animals, it is adapted to the social environment.
At bottom, the mechanism remains the same.
A perception, an image, or an idea excites an emotion,
because related, directly or indirectly (in the latter case
the relation is conceived, inductively or deductively), to
the social conditions of the individual. The natural <em>ego</em>
has its needs and tendencies; the same is true of the social
<em>ego</em>, grafted on the other, or rather, one with it; consequently,
the mechanism comes very frequently into play;
the circumference is extended, but the centre remains the
same.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us note the differences between the two periods. In
the latter we have (1) a preponderance of representations
and concepts—<i>i.e.</i>, the superior forms of knowledge; (2)
instead of a natural, innate association between certain
perceptions and certain emotional reactions—associations
which may be called anatomical, because fixed in the
individual organism—there are secondary, acquired associations,
less solidly fixed, sometimes entirely artificial,
which result from experience, from education, from habit,
from imitation. I give some examples, by way of elucidation,
and in order to avoid repetition.</p>

<p class='c017'>The feeling of property is derived from a natural condition
of existence—nutrition. It is first manifested—in
the form of a prevision—in some animals who store up a
reserve of food for the future. In primitive man this
instinct extends to clothes, weapons, the cave or hut which
he inhabits; later on, with the nomadic life, to herds and
flocks; then to agricultural products, silver, gold, paper
money; finally to that impalpable thing called credit,
which has merely an imaginary existence. Thus it gradually
takes on a social character. The knowledge of any loss or
any gain, actual or possible, produces an emotion in the
individual, because it shows him that his adaptation to
social conditions is diminished or augmented.</p>

<p class='c017'>The sentiment of “self-feeling” is innate, primary. Let
us imagine ourselves in a society where the questions of
rank, precedence, etiquette, are of capital importance—in
an aristocratic monarchy like that of Louis XIV.—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>we shall see what a ferment of emotions may be raised
by an occurrence which, to our eyes, seems futile and
irrelevant. If we read Saint-Simon’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Mémoires</cite></span>, we see him
boiling over with indignation when a courtier is unduly
accorded the privileges of a duke and peer, and his wife is
granted a stool in the Queen’s presence. He spends his
time in incessant visits, forms coalitions, does all in his
power to move the ministers or the Parliament, and finally
exults in his victory. However factitious and puerile this
agitation may seem, it results from the same physiological
mechanism as the simplest emotions: from the instinct of
personal preservation—not of his natural <em>ego</em>, but of his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego
qua</i></span> courtier of the Grand Monarque. If he fails, he is
injured, depreciated, lessened in his conditions of social
existence.</p>

<p class='c017'>The case already cited, of Malebranche, to whom
Descartes’ <i>Traité de l’homme</i> “caused such violent palpitations
of the heart that he was obliged continually to
leave his book in order to breathe,” called forth Fontenelle’s
remark that “Truth, which is invisible and of no practical
utility, is not wont to find so much sensibility among men.”
No doubt; but to the true man of science the pursuit of
truth is one of the necessary conditions of existence. For
others it is a mere luxury, to the loss of which they are
quite indifferent.</p>

<p class='c017'>I think we have thus replied to the question previously
put—why certain sensations, images, ideas, have the privilege
of producing organic and motor changes which,
translated into the language of consciousness, constitute
the emotional state—and justified our answer. The sensation,
the image, the idea, are only occasional causes,
incapable by themselves of producing any emotion: it
springs from the inmost personality of the individual—from
his <em>organisation</em>—expresses it directly, and participates in
its stability and its instability.</p>

<p class='c017'>IV.</p>

<p class='c017'>The hypothesis of James and Lange—considered, at first,
as a paradox—has suggested so many remarks, criticisms,
objections, answers, and arguments for and against, that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>find it impossible to give a summary of them.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c010'><sup>[77]</sup></a> Yet it
is not without precedent. Lange, in his <cite>Addenda</cite>, mentions
as his precursors, Malebranche, Spinoza, and some
other less celebrated authors. The legitimate claims of
Descartes, in his treatise <i>Sur les Passions de l’Âme</i>, have
also since been vindicated.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c010'><sup>[78]</sup></a> The physiologists, too, ought
not to be forgotten: Maudsley indicated the same view, without
insisting on it.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c010'><sup>[79]</sup></a> The superiority of James and Lange
consists in having put it clearly and endeavoured to support
it by experimental proofs. I have already said that
it seems to me the most probable explanation for those
who do not represent the emotions to themselves as
psychological entities. The only point in which I differ
from these authors relates to their way of putting the
proposition, not to its substance.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is evident that our two authors, whether consciously
or not, share the dualist point of view with the common
opinion which they are combating; the only difference
being in the interversion of cause and effect. Emotion is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>cause of which the physical manifestations are the effect,
says one party; the physical manifestations are the cause of
which emotion is the effect, says the other. In my view,
there would be a great advantage in eliminating from the
question every notion of cause and effect, every relation
of causality, and in substituting for the dualistic position
a unitary or monistic one. The Aristotelian formula of
matter and form seems to me to meet the case better, if we
understand by “matter” the corporeal facts, and by “form”
the corresponding psychical state: the two terms, by-the-bye,
only existing in connection with each other and being
inseparable except as abstract conceptions. It was traditional
in ancient psychology to study the relations of
“the soul and the body”—the new psychology does not
speak of them. In fact, if the question takes a metaphysical
form, it is no longer psychology; if it takes an experimental
form, there is no reason to treat it separately, because it is
treated in connection with everything. No state of consciousness
can be dissociated from its physical conditions:
they constitute a natural whole, which must be studied as
such. Every kind of emotion ought to be considered in
this way: all that is objectively expressed by movements
of the face and body, by vaso-motor, respiratory, and
secretory disturbances, is expressed subjectively by correlative
states of consciousness, classed by external observation
according to their qualities. It is a single occurrence
expressed in two languages. We have previously assimilated
the emotions to psycho-physiological organisms; this unitary
point of view, being more conformable to the nature of
things and to the present tendencies of psychology, seems to
me, in practice, to eliminate many objections and difficulties.</p>

<p class='c017'>Whether we adopt this theory or not, we have in any
case acquired the certainty that the organic and motor
manifestations are not accessories, that the study of them
is part of the study of emotion. We shall therefore have
to speak of them in some detail.</p>

<p class='c016'>As the physiological substratum of emotion, or its material
(the reader may use which expression he prefers), comprises
the organic or internal functions, and the motor functions
showing themselves outwardly, we shall follow this division.
Although it may seem artificial, it is not altogether so; the
internal manifestations are, for the most part, outside the
action of the will; the external manifestations are, in many
cases, subject to that action. In any case, this somewhat
arbitrary distinction is desirable for the sake of clearness
in exposition.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>

<p class='c019'>The relation of different emotions to the internal functions
is a subject yet in its infancy. Our knowledge of it is
still in a vague and confused state. It is at the same point
where the problem of the expression of the emotions was
before Charles Bell and Darwin; <i>i.e.</i>, we have before
us a purely empiric set of observed facts without suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>explanation. No doubt it is well known that
vaso-motor and respiratory disturbances vary according
to the emotions, but the reasons for the differences
between one case and another are often unknown and
even unexplored. Although Lange has done much in
this direction, we cannot congratulate ourselves on having
a complete presentation of all the organic and functional
manifestations which accompany the simple emotions, not
to speak of the complex forms. Still less do we know,
clearly and positively, why these and not other manifestations
are produced. Thus Hack Tuke asserts it to be a
matter of common observation that while the blush of
shame begins in the cheeks and the ears, that of anger begins
with the eyes, and that of love with the forehead. Supposing
this fact to be firmly established, we should still have to
find out why, in each case, that particular vascular region
should be affected by preference. In short, the study of
the external conditions of emotion remains at the present
time fragmentary and descriptive.</p>

<p class='c017'>The part played by the viscera in the emotions and
passions is so evident that in all ages it has arrested the
attention of mankind. On this point, for a period of
several centuries, we find, on the one hand, a popular
psychology,—which in all languages has become fixed in
the form of metaphors,—full of errors and prejudices,
but also of very sound observations; on the other hand,
scientific attempts at explanation, varying with the physiology
of the period, and expressed in terms of the current
medical doctrine. During this long period we can distinguish
two principal directions of thought: one tending to
localise the passions exclusively in the viscera, especially
the heart, the other to place them in the brain. Without
distorting facts, we might find in these two tendencies the
incomplete and unconscious form of the two reigning
theories in affective psychology, the organic and the intellectualist.</p>

<p class='c017'>It would be of no interest to retrace this long history,
to remind the reader that Plato placed courage in the
breast and the sensual appetites in the abdomen, that the
School of Salerno attributed anger to the gall, joy to the
spleen, love to the liver. The organic or visceral theory
long had an overwhelming preponderance, and Bichat, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the beginning of the century (1800), did not hesitate to
write, “The brain is not affected by the passions which
have for their <em>exclusive</em> seat the organs of internal life—the
liver, lungs, heart, spleen, etc.” From the seventeenth
century downwards, the cerebral theory becomes more
accentuated; with Gall and Charles Bell the heart is quite
dispossessed, and, by way of reaction, the part played by
the viscera was almost forgotten.</p>

<p class='c017'>At the present day no one maintains that the heart or
any other organ is the seat of an emotion in the sense of
feeling it; the consciousness of the affective life only exists
through the brain, in which the internal sensations coming
from the viscera are represented as external sensations; it
is an echo. The brain, says Hunter, knows perfectly well
that the body has a liver and a stomach, or, as Carus
expressed it, each organ has its <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>psychische Signatur</i></span>. The
ideal would be to determine, by means of a complete and
well-conducted elementary analysis, the part contributed
by each internal organ and function to the constitution of a
particular emotion. Nothing of this sort can be attempted:
there exist, on this point, only scattered materials and conjectures
supported chiefly by the phenomena of morbid
states. We shall return to this later on. (See Part II.)
Let us at this moment confine our attention to the two
predominant organs—the brain, the centre of psychic life;
the heart, the centre of vegetative life.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The brain is not merely the echo of internal sensations;
it receives and reacts according to its disposition; it
centralises, but while taking its own part in the concert;
it puts its mark on the impressions it receives. Already
(Chap. I., § 1) we have seen the theories propounded as
to the “seat” or “centre” of pain or pleasure: bulb,
protuberance, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, etc. Naturally,
each author has extended his hypothesis to the
emotions properly so called. However, the search for
“emotional centres” appears still more chimerical. A
particular emotion has no determinate centre, is not localised
in a restricted area of the encephalon. Not only
does neither observation nor experience indicate anything of
the sort, but if we consider the complexity of any emotion
whatever, we shall understand that it requires the activity of
several cerebral and infra-cerebral centres: (1) the sensory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>centres of sight, hearing, smell, etc.; (2) the centres scattered
through the motor zone and regulating the movements of
different parts of the body; (3) and lastly, the centres
corresponding to the phenomena of organic life. These
constitute several stages: in the spinal cord, the respiratory
centre, that which accelerates the movements of the
heart, the genito-spinal, the vesico-spinal (it is well known
that the bladder is as good an æsthesiometer as the iris),
etc.; in the bulb, the respiratory and vaso-motor centres,
and those of cardiac and thermic inhibition. As regards
the cortical layer, there are many open questions as to the
position of the vascular, thermic, trophic, glandular centres,
of the organic movements which determine the contraction
of the intestines, the bladder, the spleen, etc. This very
incomplete and confused enumeration is sufficient for our
purpose—viz., to show that we must speak, not of a centre,
but of the synergic action of several centres, differently
grouped according to the cases.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c010'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>It is well known that the vaso-motor nerves of the head,
the upper limbs, the lower limbs, the viscera, are furnished
in part by the nerve-reticulations of the sympathetic system,
in part by the rachidian nerves issuing from different parts
of the spinal cord. Now, an experiment of Claude
Bernard’s, made as far back as 1852, shows that the section
of the great sympathetic in the neck produces on the
same side an expansion of the vessels, and an increase in
the temperature, nutrition, muscular tonicity, and sensibility.
On the contrary, galvanism applied to the same nerve
produces constriction of the vessels and the contrary
phenomena to the preceding. Féré points out that the
manifestations of the first case are, in general, those of the
sthenic emotions, as those of the second are of the asthenic
emotions.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c010'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Whatever we may think of this comparison, the incontestable
and so often recorded characteristic of emotion—diffusion—shows
us that it is everywhere; that, if we could
see with our eyes the cerebral mechanism supporting it, we
should be spectators of the co-ordinated work of the multiple
centres; that, consequently, the hypothesis of a localisation,
of a seat in the limited sense, is in no way justified.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. It is needless to remind the reader that the majority
of idioms make the heart the incarnation of affective life,
and that the antithesis of reason and passion is, in current
speech, that of the brain and the heart. This opinion is
not entirely a prejudice, as contemporary physiologists have
shown.</p>

<p class='c017'>Why is the heart, an unconscious muscle, promoted to
the position of an essential and central organ of the emotions
and the passions? It is so in accordance with the well-known
physiological law which makes us transfer our psychic
states to the peripheral organ which communicates them to
our consciousness. It feels the rebound of all the impulses
which strike us; it reflects the most fugitive impressions;
in the order of the sentiments, no manifestation takes place
outside it, nothing escapes it; it vibrates incessantly, though
in different manners.</p>

<p class='c017'>Claude Bernard, and after him, Cyon, have undertaken to
justify the popular expressions regarding the heart, to show
that they are not mere metaphors, but the result of accurate
observation, and that they can be translated into physiological
language. I here summarise their principal remarks.</p>

<p class='c017'>The heart, the centre of organic life, and the brain, the
centre of animal life, the two culminating organs of the
living machine, are in an incessant relation of action and
reaction which shows itself in two principal states,—syncope
and emotion; the first due to the momentary cessation
of the cerebral functions through intermission in the arrival
of the arterial blood; the second due to the transmission to
the heart of a circulatory modification. There is always an
initial impression which slightly arrests this organ (<a id='corr117.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='accord- to'>according to</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_117.36'><ins class='correction' title='accord- to'>according to</ins></a></span>
Claude Bernard), whence a passing paleness, then a
reaction which the heart, by reason of its extreme sensibility,
is the first to feel; for, as the brain is the most
delicate of the organs of the animal life, the heart is the
most sensitive of the vegetative vital organs.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>When it is said that the heart is <em>broken</em> by grief, this
expression corresponds to actual phenomena. The heart
has been arrested by a sudden impression, whence, sometimes,
syncope and nervous attacks. The heart’s being
“big,” answers to a prolongation of the diastole, which
causes a feeling of fulness and oppression in the præcordial
region. The “palpitation” of the heart is not merely a
poetic formula, but a physiological reality; the beats being
rapid and without intensity. The facility with which the
heart is emptied, the regularity of the circulation being kept
up by slight pressure, corresponds to the “light” heart.
Two hearts beat “in unison,” under the influence of the
same impressions. In the “cold heart” the beats are slow
and quiet, as if under the influence of cold; in the “warm”
heart, the contrary is the case. When we tell a person that
we love him “with all our heart,” this expression signifies,
physiologically speaking, that his presence, or the recollection
of him, awakens in us a nervous impression, which,
transmitted to the heart by the pneumogastric nerve, causes
in our heart a reaction of such a kind as to produce in the
brain a sentiment or an emotion. In man, the brain, in
order to express its feelings, is obliged to take the heart into
its service.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c010'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Let us further recall the well-known observations of
Mosso, who was able directly to study the circulation of the
blood in the brain in three patients, in whom the cranium
had been destroyed by various accidents. He ascertained
that the mere fact of looking attentively at one of his
patients, the entrance of a stranger, or any other occurrence
of slight importance, immediately quickened the
cerebral pulse. In one, a woman, the height of the pulsations
suddenly increased, without apparent cause; she had
just perceived in the room a death’s-head, which somewhat
frightened her. The same thing took place with another
patient when he heard the clock strike twelve; this was
because he did not feel able to say his noon prayers. I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>not dwell on his researches by means of the plethysmograph,
which have special relation to intellectual work.</p>

<p class='c017'>It will therefore be understood how popular opinion has
come to look upon the heart as the seat, or the generator,
of emotions. This is the instinctive expression of a quite
correct view: the supreme importance to the affective life
of the visceral action summed up in a fundamental organ.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>

<p class='c019'>Since, for the moment, we are eliminating movements
in order to confine our attention to the <em>internal</em> conditions
of emotion, it is easy to see that these conditions reduce
themselves to that which we designate by the name of
internal, organic, vital sensations. This is not the place
to enumerate the modifications of each in the case of
each special emotion (for which the reader is referred to
Part II.); the question, taken for the present in its
generality, is put thus: Are the internal sensations reducible
to a single and fundamental process? If the
answer is in the affirmative, the internal conditions of
emotion would find themselves simultaneously determined
under their most general form. We can, at any rate, try.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first difficulty consists in our not having a complete
enumeration, on which all authors are agreed, of the internal
sensations, as we have in the case of the special sensations.
Beaunis gives a very detailed classification in eight groups;
Kröner adopts a somewhat different one; both include
pleasure, pain, and the emotions. Let us eliminate this last
group (the affective manifestations) and confine ourselves to
the vital sensations properly so called, connected with purely
physiological needs, with the organs and functions indispensable
to life: the different sensations of the alimentary
canal (hunger, thirst, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malaise</i></span>, nausea, etc.); those of the
respiratory apparatus (the need of fresh air, dyspnœa, asphyxia),
of the circulatory apparatus, of the excretions and
secretions; of the sexual organs in the normal state or in
transitory phases (puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause);
the need of muscular movement, of rest, of sleep;
the sensation of fatigue;—we have nearly all, if not all,
the elements of cœnæsthesia, <i>i.e.</i>, the consciousness of the
body as living and acting.</p>

<p class='c017'>Have these multiplied sensations a common cause? Are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>they different modes of one and the same process? Do
they imply, at their origin, the same stimulus, the same
kind of excitement, as all the varieties of visual sensations
suppose luminous vibrations, and the varieties of auditive
sensations, sonorous vibrations? Kröner maintains that,
for all internal sensations, the initial excitation is of a
<em>chemical</em> nature. “Every organic sensation is based on a
chemical process, and arises according to the laws of
diffusion and osmosis.”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c010'><sup>[83]</sup></a> The author justifies his assertion
by the enumeration of a large number of facts, for which I
refer the reader to his book. Chemical action, according
to him, either takes place under the gaseous form (a person
passes from the open air into a room full of deleterious
miasma) or under the liquid (alcohol, toxic substances in
solution in the fluids of the organism and introduced into
the circulatory current).</p>

<p class='c017'>It is not very certain, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pace</i></span> Kröner, that <em>all</em> internal
sensations are caused by chemical action, under one or
other of the forms we have mentioned, and that their vague
localisation is due to this cause alone, and not, as generally
admitted, by their arising in organs incapable of movement.
Thus tickling, giddiness, the muscular sensations (which
Kröner and Beaunis include in this group) appear to
depend on mechanical excitations rather than on chemical
causes. At any rate, one cannot deny that the internal
fundamental sensations—connected with nutrition and its
immediate conditions, with fatigue and sleep, both of which
result from a poisoning of the muscles and the nervous
centres, with sexual life—are due to chemically caused
excitations. This granted, we may go one step further
in the track of James and Lange, and say that the emotions
depend not only on physiological conditions, but still more
intimately on the chemical action going on in the tissues
and fluids of the organism.</p>

<p class='c017'>In support of this extreme condition of the genesis of the
emotions, we can only offer some fragmentary remarks,
which, however, show how closely they depend on the
variations of the intra-organic environment.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. We have, in the first place, the group of exciting,
tonic, depressing, toxic substances: wine and the various
alcoholic beverages, haschisch, opium, coca, the aphrodisiacs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>etc. Although they are artificial products,
introduced from without, not engendered in and by the
organism, we know how far they modify the interior
environment, and consequently the temper, character, intensity,
and direction of the passions.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. But there are also the substances which the living
body compounds or modifies for itself. It has been said
that the organism is the receptacle and laboratory of
poisons; in the state of emotion, the only one with which
we are concerned at present, the function of this chemical
process is manifested at every instant. We are always
speaking of the weakening or the increase of the circulation
of the blood; yet the emotional dispositions or modifications
are connected, not only with variations of quantity, but also
with those of <em>quality</em> in the blood (anæmia, aglobulia,
malarial poisoning, etc.). The popular expression regarding
the emotions which “curdle the blood” is not so ridiculous
as it might seem. Anger, fear, fatigue are often accompanied
by changes in the intimate constitution of the
sanguinary fluid. We may incidentally note the ascertained
relations between certain cardiac affections and affective
dispositions: in aortic affections, anæmia, excitement,
irritability; in cases of mitral insufficiency, congestion,
and a taciturn and melancholy humour. We shall elsewhere
have occasion to enumerate the facts which show the
correlation of certain emotions with toxic changes in the
saliva and the lacteal secretion. Perspiration may, in
certain affective states, be coloured red, yellow, green,
or blue, not to mention the varieties of odour, which are
assuredly of chemical origin. Even apart from mental
disease, the urinary secretion could furnish a long list of
chemical changes (azoturia, oxaluria, phosphaturia) coinciding
with variations of the affective order, such as
apprehension, melancholy, irritability. In gouty and
rheumatic patients, the modifications of temper, depending
much more on general nutrition than on active
suffering, have often been pointed out. We know the
relations between the secretion of the gastric juice and
pleasurable or painful states; dyspeptics have a well-established
reputation for being neither cheerful nor comfortable
to live with. Beaumont ascertained, in the case of
his famous Canadian, that under the influence of anger or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>other very strong emotions, the lining of the stomach was
irritated, became red, dry, and very sensitive, and an attack
of indigestion was the result. The rutting time (that of
sexual excitement) is, in many animals, accompanied by
deep-seated chemical changes, showing themselves externally
by modifications of colour and odour, and,
internally, not limited to the sexual organs, but extending
to the whole of the body. It is known that the flesh of
game is uneatable during this period, and that many fish,
at spawning-time, become poisonous. It should not be
forgotten that, during the same period, the animal becomes
vicious, violent, aggressive, and dangerous. It would be
easy to develop this point further, even as regards man
(puberty, gestation, lactation, menstruation).</p>

<p class='c017'>3. It has long been observed that, in the great majority of
cases, mental disease begins by affective disturbances and
that the intellectual aberrations only make their appearance
later. Much more recently, a doctrine has been propounded
which tends to seek the primary cause of these affective
disturbances in a self-intoxication—<i>i.e.</i>, in “the disorders
produced in the interior of the organism by the excessive
formation or the morbid retention of normal poisons; in
particular, by those originating in the digestive canal and
the urine.” Nutritive troubles through acceleration, retardation,
or perversion, are assigned as the most general
cause. In support of this, we are referred to the relations
between melancholia, hypochondria, a pessimistic
disposition, with hyperchlorhydria of the stomach, and the
good results of purgative medicines; the numerous mental
modifications coinciding with organic chemical modifications—<i>e.g.</i>,
certain attacks of mania in arthritic subjects.
“One characteristic of the mental state of diabetic patients
is the way in which the fluctuations of the mental state
correspond with those of the sugar, and the barometric (if
one may so call it) influence of the composition of the
urine on the moral disposition.” This liquid, in mania,
loses, to a great extent, its toxic character, in consequence
of the morbid retention of normal poisons which are no
longer eliminated.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c010'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>A long enumeration of facts bearing on this as yet
insufficiently studied question would be here out of place.
Besides, it could only be of real value if systematic—<i>i.e.</i>,
if under the heading of each emotion were grouped the
physiological facts invariably accompanying it, and all the
chemical modifications exclusively peculiar to it. We have
only included the chemical conditions in our study, in
order to penetrate as far as possible into the most general
conditions of affective life, and show once more why it
betrays the inmost constitution of the individual.</p>

<p class='c017'>When treating of pleasure and pain, we remarked that
they were too exclusively attributed to intensity of excitation
(excessive, it was said, for pain; moderate, for pleasure),
and that its <em>quality</em> was forgotten. Since we have to
do with hypotheses as to the part played by chemical conditions
in affective life, since they are the most general,
and since pleasure and pain also have this character of
generality, it may be permitted to hazard a conjecture.
This would consist in admitting that pleasure arises
either when excitement increases chemical activity in the
organism, without producing toxines, or when this augmentation
of activity brings about the disintegration of the normal
poisons; and that pain arises either when excitement creates
an environment appropriate to the formation of toxines, or
when, directly and at once, it promotes their formation,
either generally or locally. But I would not insist on a
simple <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>obiter dictum</i></span>, for which I can offer no proof, thrown
out merely as a suggestion with regard to a question not
as yet fully examined.</p>

<p class='c017'>We have spoken throughout of the chemical modifications
as coinciding with emotional changes. Are they
effects or causes, or both, according to circumstances? It
is clear that this question is not new to us. It is the
antithesis between the psychological and physiological
theories of emotion, presenting itself under another aspect;
there is no occasion for discussing it a second time.</p>

  <h3 id='ch1.9' class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /> THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS OF EMOTION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Empiric period—Pre-Darwinian period of scientific research—Examination
of Darwin’s three principles—Wundt
and his explanatory formulas: Innervation directly
modified, Association of analogous sensations, Relations
of motion with sensory representations.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>The movements of the eyes, mouth, face, the upper
and lower limbs and trunk, and the modifications of the
voice constitute the external expression of emotion which
is principally reducible to muscular action. For the last
half-century this subject has been studied in works so
well known that it behoves us to be very brief. I shall
confine myself to indicating the actual state of the question.</p>

<p class='c017'>For some thousands of years this question remained in
the stage of pure empiricism, or of so-called scientific speculations
which had scarcely a better reputation than alchemy,
astrology, or chiromancy. J. Müller, in the name of
physiology, declared the expression of the emotions completely
inexplicable. However, the researches were already
beginning which were to prove him mistaken—those of
Lavater with his rare talent of personal observation, and
those of Charles Bell by a more objective method. After
this, Duchenne, of Boulogne, went still further, substituting
experiment for mere observation. It is well known that, in
the case of an old man suffering from facial anæsthesia, he
caused the contraction of an isolated muscle, by the aid of
electricity, and thus produced certain modes of expression
in the countenance. He concluded from this that the
contraction of a single muscle often suffices to express a
passion; and that every emotion has, so to speak, its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>accurate, precise, and unique note, produced by a unique
local modification. Thus, the frontal is for him the muscle
of attention, the upper orbicular of the lips the muscle
of reflection, the pyramidal (inter-superciliary) expresses
threats; the great zygomatic, laughter; the lesser zygomatic,
weeping; the triangular muscle of the lips, disdain, etc.
In spite of the somewhat artificial nature of the experiments,
and the too sweeping character of the conclusions,
this was a great step in advance.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c010'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>At last appeared Darwin’s epoch-making work. Supported
by the results of a long series of experiments on
adults, children, lunatics, animals, members of the different
human races, Darwin was the first to put, and to attempt
to answer, the fundamental and only question—Why and
how is such and such an emotion connected with such and
such a movement and not with another? He stated the
problem under its scientific form.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c010'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>In Darwin’s works we find two elements: a detailed and
complete description of each individual emotion or affective
state—by which we shall profit later on—and the exposition
of the general laws of expression, as reduced to three well-known
principles. What remains of these three principles
after the criticism to which they have been subjected?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>This is the only point we have, for the moment, to
examine.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The principle of the association of serviceable habits
remains the most firmly established. It consists in admitting
that movements which are of service in satisfying
a desire, or getting rid of a disagreeable sensation, become
habitual, and continue to take place, even when their utility
becomes <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span>, or at any rate doubtful. In other words,
there are attitudes, gestures, movements, which can be
directly explained, because they are nothing but emotions
actualised, objectivised, or embodied, such as the movements
of contact in tenderness, of aggression in anger,
of erection and swelling in pride. But there are others, of
which the explanation is less direct and obvious. How are
the contraction of the eyebrows in perplexity, tears in
sorrow, the showing of the teeth in anger, to be explained
as serviceable to us? According to Darwin, these acts,
formerly serviceable, have continued to exist as survivals.
Here Darwin’s successors have rightly reproached him with
not being enough of a psychologist, and have found a
better explanation: the important fact is not the survival
of serviceable movements, but the transference of a primitive
mode of expression to an analogous emotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The principle of antithesis has been definitively
abandoned; it is purely hypothetical, and explains nothing.
According to Darwin, there is a primitive and general tendency
to associate with feelings the contrary gestures to
those expressing the opposite feeling. Léon Dumont
has subjected this assertion to a very close and cogent
criticism. Taking, one by one, the facts quoted by Darwin,
which, besides, are not very numerous, he has shown that
they may be quite otherwise explained.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c010'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>3. The principle of the direct action of the nervous
system cannot be placed in line with the other two,
because it far surpasses them in generality, and, in relation
to it, they are subordinate and not co-ordinate.
Before Darwin, Spencer (<cite>Principles of Psychology</cite>, ii. §§ 495,
502) had stated an analogous principle, to which he
reduced the expression of the emotions. He calls it the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Law of Nervous Discharge. It may show itself in two
forms—the diffused and the restricted. The former depends
on the quantity or intensity of the emotion, and serves as
its measure. It follows, in its propagation, an invariable
course: it affects the muscles in an inverse ratio to their
mass and to the weight of the parts they have to move. In
man, it acts first on the delicate muscles of the voice and
the small facial muscles; then it invades, in succession,
the arms, the legs, the trunk. The movements of the tail
in dogs and cats, of the ear in horses, and many analogous
ones in other animals, are illustrations of this law.
The restricted discharge depends on the quality or
the nature of the emotion; it is due “to the relations
established in the course of evolution between particular
feelings and particular sets of muscles habitually brought
into play for the satisfaction of them.”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c010'><sup>[88]</sup></a> This scarcely
seems to me to differ from Darwin’s principle of “useful
habits.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The <cite>Expression of the Emotions</cite> gave rise to other publications
of the same kind, those of Piderit, Mantegazza,
and Warner, who, in his <cite>Physical Expression</cite> (1885), has
attempted a purely objective, and consequently extra-psychological
study of the subject. But among all the attempts
to trace back expression to its fundamental principles, and
find a substitute for Darwin’s (already greatly shaken)
theory, that of Wundt seems to me the best.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c010'><sup>[89]</sup></a> Like his
predecessor, he admits three principles (though different
from Darwin’s) which can act simultaneously and concur
in the production of an isolated movement.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The principle of direct modification of innervation—that
is to say, that the intensity of the muscular and vasomotor
movements depends on the intensity of the emotions;
the movements which most escape the control of the will
more especially depend on this principle. This is the
equivalent to Darwin’s third principle, placed first, which is,
in fact, its right position.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The principle of the association of analogous sensations
consists in those dispositions of the mind which are
analogous to certain sensory impressions, manifesting themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>in the same manner. At the outset, we have only
pleasures, pains, and needs of the physical order, whose
mode of expression is innate, and, so to speak, anatomical.
Later on come the pleasures, pains, and desires of the moral
order, which make use of the pre-existent modes of expression
in order to show themselves outwardly. It is a language
turned aside from its primary signification, which in the
order of gestures is the equivalent of a metaphor. This
principle explains much more easily than Darwin’s a number
of apparently very perplexing modes of expression. If
a man, when puzzled, scratches his head, coughs, rubs his
eyes, it is because a slight <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malaise</i></span> of physical origin and a
slight embarrassment of psychical origin have a deep-seated
analogy, betraying themselves by the same expressive movements.
Wundt has well described the mimicry of the mouth
in the tasting of sweet, acid, or bitter substances; as soon as
an emotion arises which has some affinity with these gustatory
sensations (sweet joy, bitter grief, sharp reproaches), the
expression of the mouth, the nose, the face reappears.
This is because, in both cases, the state of the feelings, the
emotional tone are the same, the expressive movements
identical. As Mantegazza has rightly said, there are such
things as mimic synonyms.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The principle of the relation between movements and
sensory representations lies in the fact that the muscular
movements of expression relate to imaginary objects.
Wundt considers as chiefly amenable to this principle the
mimicry of the eyes, the arms, and the hands. We represent
something large by raising the hand, a small object by
lowering it; the future by a forward movement, the past
by a backward one. It might be objected that these
gestures indicate intellectual rather than affective states;
but it is certain that many emotions have a mimicry
addressed to absent objects. Gratiolet (1857) collected a
tolerably large number. The indignant man, even if alone,
clenches his fist against an absent adversary. We shut our
eyes, or turn aside our face, to escape the sight of a disagreeable
object; we do the same when disapproving of an
opinion. When we approve, we incline the head forward,
as if in contemplation. In negation, we turn the head to
right and left, exactly as is done by children and animals,
when an unattractive object is placed in front of the mouth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>The expression of disdain, contempt, disgust, reproduces the
physiognomy of a man rejecting nauseating food.</p>

<p class='c017'>I am not quite sure that Wundt’s third principle is of the
same importance as the other two, or that it cannot be
reduced to a still simpler form. But the theory I have
just summarised, with a few examples borrowed elsewhere,
presents itself as the one most calculated to bring out the
importance of the physiological factors, unduly neglected by
the pioneers of the science.</p>

<p class='c017'>All the work relating to this question, whatever may be
its <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lacunæ</i></span> at present, has demonstrated that the expression
of the emotions is not an adventitious, purely external, extra-physiological
fact, whose study is only incumbent, as
science, on the physiologist, and, as art, on the physiognomist,
but emotion itself objectivised, its inseparable
embodiment. In my opinion, we have to distinguish two
strata in the very numerous modes of muscular movement
which express the emotions. One is primary, depending
on the anatomical and physiological constitution; the
other, secondary, depending on the psychological constitution.
The relation between them is that which in
every developed language exists between the primary and
the derived sense of words. Analogy is the great artisan of
intellectual language; its action is more restricted as regards
emotional language. But when, to the emotion of the first
hour, having already its fixed mode of expression, there
succeeds a new emotion, which the consciousness, rightly
or wrongly, has felt as analogous, the pre-established
expressive mechanism has served a new purpose, like an
old word whose meaning is extended and modified. In
both cases the mind proceeds in the same way, obeying
the guidance of one and the same unconscious law.</p>

  <h3 id='ch1.10' class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br /> CLASSIFICATIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Their discrepancies—Reduced to three types: (1) Classification
of pleasures and pains—(2) Classification of emotions:
two forms, empiric and analytico-comparative—(3)
Classification of representations, intellectualist form—Critical
remarks—Impossibility of any classification.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>The confusion of that department of psychology which
deals with the feelings and the vagueness of its terminology
appear in all their fulness with the problem of classification.
Although, for reasons which will be given at the end of
the chapter, a complete and satisfactory classification seems
to me impossible, there has been no lack of attempts, and
it must be admitted that they are not illegitimate, at
any rate as approximative efforts towards a provisional
order.</p>

<p class='c017'>Within the last fifty years, in spite of the very moderate
amount of zeal with which psychologists have studied the
feelings, we find about twenty treatises signed by well-known
names, not to mention minor variants.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c010'><sup>[90]</sup></a> They are
far from being in agreement, except on some few points,
and when they are compared, in order, if possible, to
reconcile them, the first impression is one of inextricable
confusion and hopeless divergence. If we examine
them a little more carefully, we begin to see light. We
see that the differences are only in the objects classed
and the methods followed; in one word, it is possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>to attempt a classification of these classifications; and
when this is done, we find, if I am not mistaken, that
they can all be reduced to three types. (1) Some writers,
virtually, classify only pleasures and pains, tracing back
the whole of affective life to their modalities. (2) Others
classify the emotions properly so called; and here we
must distinguish two groups, according as the method
employed is purely empiric, and founded on current
observation, or has recourse to analysis and genetic research,
after the manner of the so-called natural classifications.
(3) Lastly, others classify intellectual states pure
and simple, and, conversely, the affective states which
accompany them: this is the intellectualist method.</p>

<p class='c017'>In order to justify our distinction, we shall successively
examine these three types. This excursion on an ungrateful
soil will not be altogether without, at least, a
negative utility.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>As many writers show a common tendency to reduce the
whole of the affective life to pleasures and pains, considered
as essential and fundamental phenomena, it is
natural that one category of classifications should have
been based upon these.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In the science of pleasure and pain,” says Léon
Dumont, “we no longer find ourselves, as in other
sciences, in presence of separate organs and functions;
for pleasure, like pain, belongs to all organs and all
functions. Thus, we think that to recapitulate in this
science the classification of the perceptive and intelligent
faculties, and of the will, is to give way to a psychological
tautology, which, though it causes no serious inconvenience,
in any case throws little light on the analysis” (<i>op.
cit.</i>, Pt. II., p. 1). No more could be said than this.
Yet, to classify, we require a directing principle, and where
shall we find it? “This basis is supplied to us by our
own definition of pleasure and pain: pleasure being the
augmentation of force in the whole of the conscious
individuality, pain its diminution.” Thence, Dumont
deduces the divisions found in many authors: pain is
positive when it results from an increased expenditure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>negative when it depends on absence of excitement;
pleasure is positive when there is increased excitement,
negative when the expenditure is diminished. In other
terms, if we compare the total “force” to a continually
renewed capital, we have, in the one case, either more
expenditure or less receipts, in the other either more
receipts or less expenditure.</p>

<p class='c017'>But Dumont does not stop there; he passes on to
details; he insists on classifying the species under those
four generic headings, and thus we have—Positive pains:
effort, fatigue, the ugly, the hideous, the immoral, the
false. Negative pains: weakness, exhaustion, inanition,
physical pain properly so called, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span>, perplexity, doubt,
impatience, expectation, sorrow, fear, sadness, pity. Negative
pleasures: rest, cheerfulness. Positive pleasures:
those of the senses, those of activity, such as games,
dreaming, amusements, æsthetic and intellectual pleasures,
sublimity, admiration, beauty, and their varieties.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have transcribed this classification as Dumont gives it.
I shall raise no objection, either to a division so arbitrary
as to include physical pains among the negative pains, or to
the abuse of a vague word, “force,” which he shows a
marked inclination to take in a transcendental sense. I will
only consider one point, the transition which is <em>surreptitiously</em>
made from a classification of pleasures and pains
to a classification of the emotions or something analogous.
The writer does not keep his promise of not classing “the
perceptive and intelligent faculties, and the will;” and it is
not in his power to keep it. In fact, what he has followed
is the old classic division (pleasures and pains of the
senses, the heart, the mind), which may possibly serve for
a didactic exposition, but for no other purpose.</p>

<p class='c017'>Beaunis has proposed a classification of pleasures and
pains which also has as its basis a single principle: the
various modes of motion. He discriminates three classes
of pains: the nervous centres may be inactive through
insufficiency of motion; their activity may be in excess
through exaggerated motion; or their activity may be
suddenly checked by arrest of motion. The same classification
is adopted for pleasures: inaction, activity, arrest. I am
inclined to think this division preferable to the other. He
has also attempted a detailed classification of physical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>(p. 176) and moral (p. 235) pains; but he gives none for
pleasures.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c010'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>For my part, I am inclined to believe that a classification
(in the exact sense of the word) of pleasures and pains is
an impossible task. As these characters are very general,
one can only establish exceedingly general divisions. As
soon as we go beyond this, we are, in reality, classing
internal or external sensations, percepts, images, concepts,
modes of action, accompanied by a pleasurable
or painful state, positive or negative, due to activity, overactivity,
or arrest; but the modalities of the pleasurable and
painful, which, besides, are infinite, are not classed in and
for themselves. The varieties of physical pain, the simplest,
commonest, and best studied kind, the easiest to isolate, and
the most free from concomitant representation, have never yet
been subject to a fixed classification, from Hahnemann, who
reckoned them as 73 in number, to Beaunis, who enumerates
83.</p>

<p class='c017'>In short, the “science of pleasure and pain,” as L.
Dumont somewhat emphatically calls it, belongs to the
category of sciences which do not proceed by way of classification,
since they do not as yet possess the material. We
can only lay down extremely general divisions, and then
proceed by <em>incomplete enumeration</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The emotions, at least the simplest and best defined,
present themselves as psychic states having their own
specific characteristics. They differ among themselves, not
as one mode of pleasure or pain differs from another mode,
but as one thing differs from another thing; in this way,
they appear as <em>objects</em> susceptible to classification. We
have already said that two methods have been adopted.</p>

<p class='c017'>(1) The first strongly resembles the so-called artificial
classifications, which might also be called concrete or
synthetic. It takes the emotions as realities and places
itself before them as the zoologist and the botanist place
themselves before the varieties of animals and plants. It is
empirical—<i>i.e.</i>, it has no guiding principle; it classifies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>according to observation only, following external resemblances
and differences.</p>

<p class='c017'>Bain may be cited as one of the principal representatives
of this method. I will not insist on a piece of work
unworthy of such a psychologist; yet he has done it twice
over, without arriving at an agreement with himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>His earlier classification gives as fundamental the
emotion of relativity (surprise, astonishment), terror,
tenderness, self-esteem, anger, the sense of power, of
activity, of mental exercise, æsthetic emotion, moral
emotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>The later includes eleven groups: love, anger, fear, the
sentiment of property, the pleasure of power and its correlative
pain of subjection, pride, vanity, activity (“plot-interest”),
knowledge (the intellectual feeling), æsthetic
emotion (beauty), moral sentiment. Three of these are
“simple”—anger, love, and fear; but we find, a little later
on, that love and anger are called “the giants of the
group, the commanding and indispensable members of the
emotional scheme;” so that fear would seem to be
eliminated.</p>

<p class='c017'>The incoherence and inconsistency of this attempt are
sufficiently obvious, and I need not insist on them. (It
should be noted that, in both cases, the religious sentiment
is omitted.) I can find only one valuable remark—viz.,
that “pleasures and pains are contained in every one of the
classes to be described, just as the natural orders of plants
may each contain food and poison, sweet aromas and
nauseating stinks.”<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c010'><sup>[92]</sup></a> I have only referred to this classification
in order to show how, by its very nature, it is
condemned to failure. Floating at haphazard, without
fixed principle, when not contradictory, it can only be
arbitrary.</p>

<p class='c017'>Herbert Spencer has criticised it in a well-known passage,
which I will briefly recapitulate, since it serves as a transition
to the second form of classification, and throws some
light on the latter.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c010'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Bain has overlooked the fact that in
confining his attention to the most obvious characteristics
of the emotions, he is following the method of the ancient
naturalists, who classed the cetacea among fishes. Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>classification should be preceded by a rigorous analysis.
For this purpose it would be necessary, as a preliminary, to
study the ascending evolution of the emotions through the
animal kingdom, to find out which of them are the first to
appear, coexisting with the lowest forms of organisation and
intelligence, and to note the existing differences, as regards
emotion, between the higher and lower human races.
Those common to all may be considered as simple, and
those peculiar to the civilised races as ulterior and
derivative.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Inspired by the above observations, Dr. Mercier has
worked out a classification which I shall give as an example
of the analytic and comparative method. It is in any case
the most recent and the most detailed.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c010'><sup>[94]</sup></a> Proceeding after
the manner of zoologists and botanists, he divides into
classes, sub-classes, genera, and species, forming seventeen
tables. We gather from these that there are 6 classes and
23 genera, under which may be ranged (after deducting all
repetitions and duplicate entries) 128 manifestations of
feeling, such as are to be found in common experience and
rendered in current language. It is not possible, nor would
it serve any useful purpose, to present this classification here
in detail; I shall only indicate the 6 great classes with
some sub-divisions, which will enable us to understand
their nature.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first class includes the feelings primarily affecting
the conservation of the physical or mental organism.
It comprises 2 sub-classes (according as the primary
excitation is initiated by the environment, or within the
organism itself), 2 orders, and 9 genera.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second is that of the feelings primarily affecting
the perpetuation of the race, considered as simple wants.
Two sub-classes: primary (sexual emotion and its varieties)
and secondary (paternal, maternal, filial, etc., feelings).</p>

<p class='c017'>With the third class we leave behind the region of the
primitive and fundamental feelings. It includes those
which relate to the common welfare (community, family,
etc.). It comprises 2 orders, each of which is further
divided into several genera—viz., the patriotic and the
ethical emotions.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>The fourth class (only vaguely differentiated from the
preceding) is that of the feelings relating to the welfare of
others: sympathy, benevolence, pity, and their opposites.</p>

<p class='c017'>The fifth class comprises the feelings which are neither
conservative nor destructive, so that here we pass beyond
the region of pure utility, whether individual or social. It
is divided into 2 orders and 5 genera—viz., admiration,
surprise, the æsthetic feeling, the religious feeling, and the
“feeling of recreation.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The sixth and last class is that of the feelings which
correspond to abstract relations (in ordinary nomenclature
designated as intellectual feelings)—conviction, belief, doubt,
perplexity, scepticism. It has no sub-divisions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Even when all details are omitted, the general drift of
this work must be sufficiently apparent to the reader. Although
conducted according to a fixed method, it does not
escape the difficulties inherent in <em>every</em> classification of the
emotions. In the first place, the order of filiation is not
always very well marked. The author himself recognises
that an arrangement in series is not possible, but this
difficulty has also presented itself in zoology and botany.
We meet with repetitions, <i>i.e.</i>, forms of sentiment figuring
several times over in different categories. This, too, is
inevitable. The complex emotions (or some of them, at
least) are formed by anastomoses: they are rivers formed
by converging streams coming from various sources lying in
different directions. One may legitimately refer them to
one or other of these origins; but the attribution will be
partial and arbitrary. The religious sentiment, for instance,
is included in the class of intellectual emotions. But its
social character is undeniable (a point we shall return to in
the proper place); let us recall, in passing, the worship of
ancestors and deified heroes, and the strictly national
religions of antiquity, the communities, orders, confraternities,
corporations, the missionary work carried
on in modern times, and, above all, the contagious
character of religious emotion in general. It is false,
moreover, to say that this emotion “tends neither to the
preservation nor the destruction of the individual.” It
might therefore be just as well—or just as ill—placed in
the third class. As soon as we pass from simple to
complex emotions, it is of more importance to determine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>their composition than their filiation. Now, this procedure
belongs rather to chemical than to zoological classification.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>

<p class='c019'>A third type of classification, peculiar to the intellectualists,
consists in classing according to the intellectual states, in so
far as these are accompanied by affective elements. This
system sprang from the psychology of Herbart, is based
on it, and is met with in the works of the principal representatives
of his school, Waitz, Drobisch, and especially
Nahlowsky in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Das Gefühlsleben</cite></span> (pp. 44 <i>et seq.</i>). This
method is peculiar to Germany, and its influence is still
perceptible even in Wundt, and more recently in Lehmann’s
book (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 338 <i>et seq.</i>). In England, Shadworth
Hodgson approaches this type.</p>

<p class='c017'>Apart from the procedure common to all, these classifications
agree still less in detail than those of the first two
types. Taken broadly, they have an academic aspect; they
are frittered away in divisions, sub-divisions, distinctions,
whence there arises more darkness than light. There is,
however, a dichotomy peculiar to them corresponding to
a reality which is not met with in the two previously-mentioned
types, and, on this account, deserves notice.</p>

<p class='c017'>This kind of classification, in the first place, establishes
two great categories of emotions—those depending on the
<em>contents</em> of the representations, and those depending on the
<em>course</em> of the representations. Let us compare the flux of
the states of consciousness to that of a river, which, according
to the nature of the soil and the state of the sky,
runs, sometimes clear, sometimes muddy, sometimes blue
or green, sometimes greyish. Besides these various aspects,
there is yet another kind, depending on the movement of
the water, sometimes slow, sometimes rapid, here stagnant,
there broken by the abrupt windings of the banks. One of
these corresponds to the course, the other to the contents
of the representations on which the affective states are
based.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first class (the contents) comprises the qualitative
emotions, which are generally divided into inferior or
sensory, and superior, which are intellectual, æsthetic,
moral, or religious, according as the ideas exciting their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>feelings are those of the true, the beautiful, the good, or
the absolute.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second class (the course of the representations)
comprises the <em>formal</em> emotions—<i>i.e.</i>, those depending on
the different forms of the course of ideas, on the relations
existing between them. Nahlowsky distinguishes four
species—(1) the feeling of expectation and impatience;
(2) that of hope, anxiety, surprise, doubt; (3) of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span>;
(4) of refreshment and work.</p>

<p class='c017'>The only merit of this classification is its showing
that there are affective manifestations depending only on
relations—transitions from one intellectual state to another.
This merit, however, depends on the essential defect of
the system, which consists in dealing with perceptions,
representations, and ideas only—not with affective states
taken in themselves, and directly. As this method of
procedure is, definitively, an intellectual classification, it
ought not to omit any form of knowledge, not even those
blurred and evanescent states—the relations—which unite,
disjoin, exclude, draw together, eliminate, subordinate, in
short, indicate the <em>movements</em> of thought, and which students
have often made the mistake of forgetting. It remains to
be known whether many relations are not states of an
affective rather than an intellectual nature; this is a point
which I shall examine later on.</p>

<p class='c017'>We may console ourselves for this multiplicity and
divergence of classifications by saying that the naturalists
have not been more successful. It will be granted without
difficulty that it is easier to classify animals than affective
states; yet, to take our own century only, how many
systems!—from Lamarck, Cuvier, Oken, to Blanville,
Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Siebold, Ehrenberg, Richard Owen,
Von Baer, Vogt, Agassiz, and finally to Häckel—if we cite
only the principal names!</p>

<p class='c017'>I have indicated in passing why a true classification
of the emotions—<i>i.e.</i>, a distribution into orders, genera,
species, according to the dominant and subordinate
characters—is impossible. Every classification, if not
purely empirical, expresses a general theory of affective
life, a “system,” and, consequently, a hypothesis. More
than this, it can never congratulate itself on having exhausted
its matter, for every emotion, simple or compound,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>admits of innumerable varieties determined by the individual,
the race, the epoch, and the course of civilisation;
some are extinct, others, again, of recent origin. Lastly,
the existence of mixed emotions—which are numerous—is a
fatal objection to every attempt at distribution into a linear
series. The only track to follow is that of genetic filiation—viz.,
to state first the simple, primary emotions, then
to find out by what mental processes, conscious or unconscious,
the composite and derived emotions have
arisen from them. We shall attempt to define these in
a future chapter.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c010'><sup>[95]</sup></a> But this work is no longer a classification.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>After the numerous researches made, during the last
twenty years, into the nature and the revivability of
visual, auditory, tactile-motor, and verbal images, it seems
paradoxical to maintain that there is still an unexplored
region in the domain of memory. As a matter of fact,
however, we find at most a few scattered remarks on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>images derived from smell, taste, internal sensations,
pleasure, pain, and emotion in general. The question of
the emotional memory remains nearly, if not quite, untouched.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c010'><sup>[96]</sup></a>
The object of this chapter is to begin its study.</p>

<p class='c017'>The impressions of smell and taste, our visceral sensations,
our pleasant or painful states, our emotions and
passions, like the perceptions of sight and hearing, can leave
memories behind them. This is a matter of common
experience on which it is needless to insist. These residua,
fixed in an organisation, may return into the consciousness;
and it is known that images may be revived in two
ways—by provocation, or spontaneously.</p>

<p class='c017'>Revivability on provocation is the simplest of all. It
consists in an actual occurrence awakening the images of
similar occurrences at some former time, and takes place,
beyond possibility of doubt, in the class of images
which occupies us just now. The actual sensation of
fatigue, of the smell of a lily, of the taste of pepper, of
pain in a certain tooth, appear to me as the repetition of
sensations formerly experienced, similar to the present one,
or at least apparently identical, so that, consequently, it
revives them.</p>

<p class='c017'>But can the images of olfactory and gustatory sensations,
of internal sensations, of past pains and pleasures, of
emotions formerly experienced, be revived in the consciousness
spontaneously, or at will, independently of any actual
occurrence which might provoke them? We know that, in
some painters, the inner vision is so clear that they can
draw a portrait from memory; that, in some musicians, the
inner hearing is so perfect that they can, like Habeneck,
ideally hear a symphony just played, recalling all the details
of the execution, and the slightest variations in the time.
Are there in the order of emotional representations any
cases analogous to these? Such is, in its precise form,
the question which we shall examine in detail. We shall
subsequently see that it has a practical bearing, and is
not a mere psychological curiosity.</p>

<p class='c017'>Before entering on the subject, I will summarise the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>principal facts relating to this question to be found
scattered through the works of various authors. I divide
them into four groups:—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. We may take taste and smell together. This last
sense is much more extensive, much richer and more varied
than the other; common speech often confounds them,
enriching taste at the expense of smell. Although unscientific,
this confusion does not greatly concern us.</p>

<p class='c017'>Every one knows that professional tasters, cooks, certain
chemists and perfumers, can distinguish the most delicate
gradations and correctly identify them with previous
sensations; but this is a provoked recollection. Does a
spontaneous or voluntary relation exist between these two
groups of images? Examining the fullest monographs
drawn up by physiologists<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c010'><sup>[97]</sup></a> we find scarcely any information
on this point. Cloquet, Müller, Valentin have reported
cases of subjective sensations attributed by them to internal
causes; but other physiologists, such as Ludwig, without
denying these, are of opinion that sapid particles in the
mouth, and odoriferous molecules on the mucous membrane
of the nose, may act in a similar manner; so that the
alleged images would, in fact, be sensations.</p>

<p class='c017'>Dreams may afford us a better starting-point. Among
the numerous writers who have treated of this subject, some
resolutely deny the existence of representations of taste and
smell. It is impossible to accept this opinion. Though
they are comparatively rare, examples may be found which
are proof against all criticism. A person who, for hygienic
reasons, has abstained from wine for several years, assures
us that he has had a very clear impression of its taste in the
course of a dream. We may recall the hypnagogic hallucinations
so well described by A. Maury, who was subject
to them; he mentions the taste of rancid oil, and the smell
of burning as occurring apart from any objective cause.</p>

<p class='c017'>Among hallucinations properly so called, it is known that
those of smell are of very frequent occurrence. Many
authorities hesitate to admit those of taste, which they
reduce to the status of mere illusions; but we know that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the distinction formerly maintained between these two
pathological manifestations has been, in our day, much
disputed.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Internal sensations play a prominent part in the
emotional life. Are these susceptible, in the normal condition,
of spontaneous or voluntary revival? I have not
been able to find any precise information on this point. In
the pathological condition we can find numerous examples
in hypochondriacs, hysterics, and neuropaths, in insane
patients who complain of the suppression of some of their
organs, of inversion of the stomach. In any case it would
be necessary to determine the part played by the organ
itself, and its actual state in the majority of these cases of
revival, which is extremely difficult.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. As for pleasures and pains, under their double (physical
and mental) form, there is no doubt. The recollection of a
blinding light, of a discord or a strident sound, of the extraction
of a tooth, or some more serious operation; the
prospect of a good dinner to an epicure, of the approaching
holidays to a schoolboy—all the states of psychic life
generally included under the designation of imaginary
pleasures and pains, show how frequent is the revival of
impressions on the feelings. And, in fact, the difficulty
is not to establish their existence, but to determine their
nature.</p>

<p class='c017'>We may also recall the facility with which, in hypnotised
subjects, pleasant or painful conditions of all sorts may be
induced by suggestion.</p>

<p class='c017'>Finally, in certain cases, the impression may even become
completely hallucinatory—<i>i.e.</i>, equal in intensity to the
reality itself. “A student,” says Gratiolet, “playfully struck
his companion’s out-stretched finger with the handle of a
scalpel. The latter felt a pain so acute that he thought the
instrument had pierced his finger to the bone.” During a
popular tumult in the reign of Louis-Philippe, a combatant
received a slight contusion from a spent bullet on his
shoulder. The skin was not even scratched, but “he felt a
torrent of blood flowing from the wound over his breast.”
Bennett relates that a butcher remained hanging by one
arm from a hook. He was taken down by the terrified
bystanders, uttered frightful cries, and complained that he
was suffering cruelly, while all the time the hook had only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>penetrated his clothes, and the arm was uninjured.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c010'><sup>[98]</sup></a> This
condition might be termed a <em>hallucination of the feelings</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>4. The supply of observations and documents relating to
the revivability of the emotions and passions is a very
scanty one. In fact, we may admit that what has already
been said as to pleasures and pains is also applicable to this
last group. But it is not on the question of fact that the
attention of psychologists has been concentrated. They are
occupied entirely with theory, and in determining the nature
of emotional memory. The majority consider the recollection
to be merely that of the accompanying circumstances
of emotion. Others hold it to be a recollection of the
emotion itself, as such. As this is the principal point of
my subject, and will have subsequently to be discussed in
detail, I must limit myself, for the moment, to the mere
indication of the two opinions.</p>

<p class='c017'>In short,—confining ourselves to the normal, and setting
aside the pathological states,—the facts collected seem to
me utterly inadequate for answering the question stated
above.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>It was for this reason that I proposed to myself the task
of collecting fresh documents, and of inquiring whether
there are not great differences between one individual and
another as regards the memory of impressions. This would
explain the want of harmony among authorities on this
point.</p>

<p class='c017'>Having eliminated all vague and doubtful answers, and
those which are not to the point, I have collected about
sixty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dossiers</i></span>. Each person (all being adults, of both sexes,
and various stages of culture) was directly questioned by
myself, and the answers immediately noted. Besides these,
I have received several long written communications, which
I reckon among my best material. The nature of the
questions asked will be sufficiently evident from the following
summary, which contains the principal results of my
inquiry. I shall confine myself to a bare statement of the
facts; the interpretation will come later.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>1. <i>Images of taste and smell.</i>—I was disposed to admit
that they are not subject to any spontaneous revivability,
and still less to a voluntary one, being, for my own part,
quite incapable of recalling a single one, even in the
faintest degree. The answers have put me completely in
the wrong—the negatives being 40 per cent., the positives
60 per cent. More accurately, 40 per cent. persons revive
no image, 48 per cent. revive some, 12 per cent. declare
themselves capable of reviving all, or nearly all, at
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c017'>The majority of cases, therefore, allows of the spontaneous
revival of some odours only. Those most frequently
mentioned are pinks, musk, violets, heliotrope, carbolic
acid, the smell of the country, of grass, etc. The conditions
under which the image appears are various. For
some persons this is unaccompanied by any visual, tactile,
or other representation. With the majority, the imaginary
odour ultimately excites the corresponding visual image
(that of a flower, a bottle of scent, etc.). Many have first
to evoke the visual image, and, in time, succeed in exciting
the olfactory one. Two individuals affirm that, on reading
the description of a landscape, they immediately perceive
the characteristic odours. Here the sign is sufficient. One
of them, a novelist, is sometimes conscious of thirst under
the same conditions.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the two following cases the “olfactory image” only
exists in a single instance, and appears to be produced by
the combined operation of concomitant circumstances.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c017'>Case 1. “I had been to the hospital, to see my friend B., who
was suffering from a cancer in the face.... When he spoke it
was necessary to come quite close in order to hear what he said,
and thus, in spite of the antiseptic dressings, an acrid, fetid
odour forced itself on one’s nostrils.... I was to go again to
see him—I had promised to do so; but this prospect was
intensely repugnant to me. While walking in a part of Paris,
where neither space nor fresh air was wanting, I reproached
myself silently for not having gone to see the poor patient....
At this very moment I perceived, as though I had been close to
him, the same acrid odour, recognisable as that of a cancerous
tumour—so suddenly that I instinctively held my sleeve to
my nose in order to see whether I had not brought away the
smell in my clothes. This, however, was immediately succeeded
by the reflection that I had not been to the hospital for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>five days, and that, moreover, I was not wearing the same
overcoat as on the occasion of my visit.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Case 2. "I can only recall two odours: one inextricably
connected with the memory of a sick-room—a stale smell of
drugs and vitiated air, truly disagreeable when it recurs, as at
the present moment....</p>

<p class='c017'>“It has happened to me to discover a very peculiar and
indefinable odour in the presence of a hypnotiser (M. R——)
when he was putting me to sleep, and I had not quite reached
the lethargic state. I have since noticed that very often (not
always) the memory of this curious odour accompanies the
recollection of the hypnotiser. This seems to me all the more
convincing, because, the odour being very subtle when M.
R—— is near me, the revival must be absolute to allow of
the return of the sensation, in however slight a degree.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>I should hesitate to admit the spontaneous or voluntary
revival of almost all odours, if this fact had not been
affirmed to me, in perfect good faith, by educated and
competent witnesses. I give some extracts from these
declarations: “I can perceive nearly all characteristic
odours, and can call them up at will; at this moment I
am thinking of the country of the Rhine, and am fully
conscious of its odour.” “I can recall the greater number
of odours (but not all) either spontaneously or voluntarily.
(In the latter case time is required.)—Can you perceive,
<em>here</em> and <em>now</em>, the scent of roses, and, if so, of what kind?—I
perceive it <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in genere</i></span>; but, on further persevering, I find it
to be the scent of withered roses. The visual representation
occurs afterwards.” The only person who has told me
that he finds all odours perceptible at will always finds a
preliminary visual representation necessary.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c010'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>As to the recollections of tastes, by themselves, the
answers are very vague. One remembers “easily, and at
will, the taste of salt, with a very clear visual impression,”
but less easily the other three fundamental tastes. Another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>who uses for his throat three different kinds of lozenges,
“feels the taste of them beforehand, as soon as he needs
them, on either seeing or touching them.” In general, the
revivability of tastes appears to me especially connected
with that of ordinary food, and with the state of the
alimentary canal (hunger).</p>

<p class='c017'>2. <i>Internal sensations.</i>—My inquiry does not include the
whole of these, but only the commonest and most easily
observed.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c010'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>As regards hunger, I have received 51 definite answers,
24 persons saying they can distinctly recall it, 27 that they
cannot. (The question has always been put at an hour
when the real sensation did not exist, and some have told
me that in their normal condition they never feel either
hunger or thirst.) It is usually described as a tactile sensation
in the œsophagus, or a twitching pain in the stomach, etc.
One person only affirms that he can, “at will, feel hunger
and thirst, even after having eaten and drunk.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Thirst is imagined much more frequently than hunger,
and, as it seems, more clearly (36 affirmative to 15 negative
answers). It is described as dryness in the throat,
heat, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>As regards the representation of fatigue, the answers have
without exception been affirmative. The modes of representation
are various. Some feel it (ideally) in the
muscles; others under a cerebral form. Here are some
examples: “muscular twitchings in the calves of the legs,
the back, and the shoulders; the eyes feeling swollen, but
no heaviness in the head;” “a feeling of relaxation, of a
weight, localised in the shoulders, because, in a normal
state, I find stooping very difficult;” “slowness of movement,
with a feeling of weight in the head;” <a id='corr147.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='general'>“general</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_147.32'><ins class='correction' title='general'>“general</ins></a></span>
lassitude, of a diffused kind, especially a feeling of weight
in the head, and mental weariness;” “pains in the joints,
and a heavy feeling in the brain.” Although all my
correspondents can revive the feeling of fatigue, three or
four can only succeed in doing so “with difficulty and to a
slight extent.”</p>

<p class='c017'>We find the same results with regard to the representation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>disgust. I find only three negative answers, all accompanied
by the remark, “I have a good digestion.” One of these
cases is the more singular because the subject has suffered
from sea-sickness. In its acute form the representation
is described as “like the beginning of nausea.” For others,
it is “a pain in the stomach, with a retractile movement,
connected with the idea of cod-liver oil, or of tainted meat.”
Among those who have experienced the sensation of sea-sickness,
I have not met with one who cannot easily revive
it (giddiness, feelings of a rocking motion, which disinclines
them to persist in reviving the impression). M. X—— (a very
competent observer in psychological questions) says: “I
have a pretty good visual memory, but no auditive, either
musical or linguistic; I cannot spell a foreign language.
Except for muscular memory, which in me is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span> (so that I
have never succeeded in acquiring any physical exercise,
or playing on any instrument), I can revive all internal
sensations: hunger, thirst, disgust, fatigue, giddiness,
difficulty in breathing; I prefer not to insist upon this last
state, as were I to think of it any longer I should actually
bring it on.”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c010'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>3. <i>Pains and Pleasures.</i>—To the question, “Can you
revive in yourself the memory of a given physical pain, a
sorrow, a pleasure, or a pity?” the answer is nearly always
in the affirmative. But, put in this bald way, it teaches us
nothing. We require more detailed information. We here
return to the main point of our subject, and I am obliged
slightly to anticipate my conclusions. The observations,
carefully taken, show that there are two distinct forms of
emotional memory, one <em>abstract</em>, the other <em>concrete</em>. Later
on, I shall insist on their differences; for the moment, I
shall confine myself to the enumeration of facts.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Painful States.</i>—Toothache, being very common, has
supplied me with many answers. I note in nearly all of
these the predominance of the motor elements: shooting
and throbbing pains, contortions of the jaw, etc. When
the extraction of a tooth is recalled there is a jarring of the
whole head, a feeling of twisting, snapping, noises, etc. In
many cases the painful element seems to be scarcely revived,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>or not at all; in many others it reappears with the utmost
clearness.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c017'>Case 3. “I send you a personal observation made during the
last few days. I had suffered from toothache, which was very
acute, and certainly intenser than the unpleasant feeling experienced
when the dentist operates on your teeth with his revolving
machine. Yet when I think of it now, and try to recall, on the
one hand the pain, on the other the rubbing of the teeth by the
machine, it is the latter which seems to me, in my recollection,
the most disagreeable. I explain this by the fact that this
rubbing is accompanied by a noise which I can recall most
vividly, and this auditive representation is by itself sufficient to
evoke a disagreeable feeling. The pain in the teeth is also
connected with different accessories: inclination of the head,
closing of the eye on the side affected, movement of the hand
to the corresponding cheek, etc., but these accessories have no
great influence on me; they are not so characteristic of toothache
as the peculiar noise of the machine. This last representation
is very vivid; when I think of it I feel a chill run down my
back and a slight trembling in the arms. The representation
of the actual pain is, in my case, much more vague; it is
diffused, I have to eke it out with verbal descriptions, and it
does not act on me so disagreeably as the first.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Cuts, burns, etc., are remembered tolerably well. “In
my youth I was wounded by a pistol-shot; I have a perfect
recollection of the shock, which first produced a tactile
sensation radiating from a centre, and afterwards pain, but
I have a difficulty in recalling the painful element in the
sensation.” Another can well remember the vesical contractions
of a cystitis; but not without the help of the
motor elements, as in the case of toothache. M. B——,
who appears to belong to the affective type (I shall explain
later on what I mean by this), feels the beginnings
of a lancinating neuralgia in the eye, a cramp in the
stomach, a smarting of the anus, a bite on the tongue.
Another (same type) says, “If I were to try, I could recall
the feeling of neuralgia, but I cannot represent to myself
the pain of a boil.” Another: “There are some pains
which I can feel at will; I either feel nothing at all, or the
representation is so vivid that it almost amounts to actual
pain. This is true especially of cardiac pains.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It was my intention to question those who had undergone
important operations; but, from the very general use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>of anæsthetics, there was little to be hoped for from such an
experiment. There remains a case of frequent occurrence—the
pains of childbirth. The answers are contradictory.
One woman, who has had five confinements, declares that
“as soon as it is over, there is nothing more.” This is a
woman of vigorous health and unshaken optimism. Another
says, “As soon as the pain is over, I can forget it at once.”
The physician of a lying-in hospital told me that “nearly
all, during their confinement, say that nothing would induce
them to undergo such suffering again; yet nearly all return
to the hospital.” Others say that they have, afterwards, a
very clear and precise recollection of the labour-pains.
Though these answers are so contradictory, we shall see,
further on, how they are to be reconciled with one another.</p>

<p class='c017'>Case 4. No revivability of the impression of labour-pains.
Nervous subject. Good visual memory; no auditive
memory; cannot recall either a taste or a smell; has made
observations on herself in view of the subject in hand, and
has sent me the following notes:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c017'>"The first acute pains appeared about every fifteen or twenty
minutes; during these intervals of repose they vanished, leaving
no trace. During the intervals between the crises, the patient
tried to represent to herself the pain she had just passed through,
and found it absolutely impossible to do so. She could describe
the pain in words,—pains in the back, the side, etc.,—and it was
this verbal description which came back to her whenever she
tried to recall her feelings at the time. Afterwards the pains
became more and more frequent, and she could make no more
observations. When they were extremely acute, she screamed
and talked the whole time. It is curious to note that she did
not pronounce her words as usual, but uttered each syllable
several times, as thus: ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ça, ça, ça, ça, fait, fait, fait, fait, très,
très, maaaaal</i></span>.’ She entreated her husband to kill her, to cut
her into small pieces, to tear her asunder, if only there might
be an end of it. After five hours of suffering, the doctor declared
that all these pains had in nowise advanced the situation—that
everything was as at the beginning. This declaration produced
an acute feeling of despair, added to the pain. Five hours later
all was over. Next day, when she tried to represent the pain to
herself, there came into her mind only the verbal description,
and afterwards the sum of her utterances during labour; she
remembered that she had been unable to contain herself, that
she understood the absurdity of what she had been saying to
her husband, but thought, at the same time, ‘People sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>do absurd things—why should he not do what I ask him?’ She
remembered clearly that, after the doctor’s declaration, she had
a feeling of despair; but she recalled it in words, not as a
feeling."</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>In conclusion, I will quote from Fouillée, in connection
with physical pain, an interesting observation made on
himself:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c017'>“If I want to recall any given attack of toothache, I must
form a mental image of the teeth where the pain was localised,
and then of the word <em>pain</em> which serves as a sign; but how am
I to form an image of the pain <em>in itself</em>? Some philosophers
declare the thing impossible, and allege that we only reproduce
perceptions, intellectual states, and words. This is, in fact, what
usually happens; but one can also, in my opinion, reproduce in
the consciousness (though incompletely) the <em>painful</em> element of
toothache. To this end we must employ an indirect method.
This procedure consists in directly calling up the images and
motor reactions which accompany or follow toothache. I make
the experiment, localising my thoughts in one of the molars on
the right side; then I wait. The first thing to revive is a vague
and general state, common to all painful sensations. Then this
reaction grows more precise, as I concentrate my attention
more and more on the tooth. At last I feel a greater afflux of
blood into the gum, and even throbbings. Then I represent to
myself a certain movement passing from one point of the tooth
or gum to another; this is the passage of the pain. Thus I also
revive the motor reaction caused by the pain, the convulsion of
the jaw, etc. Finally, by thinking fixedly of all these circumstances,
I end by feeling in a more or less dull way the rudiments
of shooting pains. In an experiment just made, I have brought
on real toothache in a molar, which, however, is subject to
it.... The experiment leaves behind it a general irritability of
the teeth, and an inclination to pass the tongue over the
gums.”<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c010'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Except for a few exceedingly clear observations, which I
shall give later on, I have only vague replies regarding the
revivability of sorrow, or moral pain, after the elimination
of the conditions in which it had its origin. One person
represents to himself “a general inertia and a febrile condition.”
Another, who, during his time of military service,
underwent periods of depression and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span>, “a year later,
when the recollection comes back to him, sees everything
of a grey hue.” We shall see presently that in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>individuals the revival of moral pain is as acute as the
initial state.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Pleasant States.</i>—The same results are obtained, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mutatis
mutandis</i></span>, as with the preceding group. I note a very
marked predominance of the motor elements. The
pleasures most frequently mentioned are those of skating,
swimming, the trot or gallop of a horse, and various
physical exercises. Those who <em>really</em> revive agreeable
recollections, describe a general state of excitement, a
dilatation of the chest, a lighting up of the countenance, a
tendency towards childish gestures. One, in thinking of
his rides, feels the pleasure of rapid motion, the wind
playing over his cheeks, etc. Musicians can easily revive
their pleasure by means of inner hearing alone. We find
one who cannot think of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Walkürenritt</i></span> without feeling
himself lifted as if by motor impulses.</p>

<p class='c017'>4. <i>Emotions.</i>—The phenomena of this group, though
more complex, are, in fact, only a prolongation of our third
group. But, in order to obtain a correct notion of their
revivability, we must not proceed by way of generalities.
To ask any given individual whether he is capable of
reviving past emotions would be a useless question. I have
always asked persons to try and recall a <em>particular</em> case of
a particular emotion (fear, anger, love, etc.). The answers
are reducible to three categories, which I shall enumerate
in the order of their frequency.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the greater number of cases, only the conditions,
circumstances, and accessories of the emotion can be
recalled; there is only an <em>intellectual</em> memory. The
past event comes back to them with a certain emotional
colouring (and sometimes even this is absent), a vague
affective trace of what has once been but cannot be
recalled. In the affective order these subjects are
analogous to those of moderately good visual and auditory
memory in the intellectual order. C——, who, when
standing on a rock, narrowly escaped being surrounded by
the tide, sees the waves rising, and recalls his desperate rush
for the shore, which he reached in safety; but the emotion
as such does not return to him. At Constantine, some
years ago, I nearly fell into the gorge of the Rummel.
When I think of the incident I can see before me quite
clearly the landscape, the state of the sky, all the details of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the spot; but the only return of feeling is a slight shiver in
the back and legs.</p>

<p class='c017'>Others (far less numerous) recall the circumstances <em>plus</em>
the revived condition of feeling. It is these who have the
true “affective memory”; they correspond to those who
have good visual or good auditory memories. This is the
case with the majority of emotional temperaments. As we
here touch on the most obscure and disputed part of our
subject, it will be convenient to give some examples.</p>

<p class='c017'>Irascible subjects, on hearing the name of their enemy,
at the mere thought can revive the rising feelings of
anger. The timid person shudders and turns pale when
recalling the danger once incurred. The lover, thinking of
his mistress, completely revives the state of love. If
we compare the recollection of an extinct passion with
the occurrence to the mind of a passion still existing, we
shall clearly perceive the difference between intellectual and
affective memory, between the mere recollection of the
circumstances and the recollection of the emotion as such.
It is a serious error to assert that only the conditions of the
emotion can be revived, not the emotional state itself.
I now only touch on this question, to which I shall
return.</p>

<p class='c017'>Several of my correspondents affirm that the memory of
an emotion affects them as strongly as the emotion itself,
which I have no difficulty in believing. Does not the
recollection of a foolish action make one blush? One
asserts that “her representation of emotions is more acute
than the emotions themselves, and that she can recall them
much better than visual, auditive, and other sensations.”
But a few detailed observations will make the nature of
true affective memory clearer.</p>

<p class='c017'>Littré relates that, at the age of ten, he lost a young sister
under very painful circumstances. He felt acute grief at
the time; “but a boy’s sorrow does not last long.” At an
advanced age this grief suddenly returned, without apparent
cause. “Suddenly, without wish or effort on my part, by
some phenomenon of affective automnesia, this same event
reproduced itself with feelings no less painful, certainly, than
those I had experienced at the moment of its occurrence,
and which went so far as to bring tears into my eyes.” It
was several times repeated in the course of the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>days; then it ceased and gave place to the habitual
recollection, <i>i.e.</i>, to the purely intellectual form of
memory.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c010'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>It is natural to suppose that emotional revival must be
of frequent occurrence in poets and artists. M. Sully-Prudhomme,
whose philosophical aptitudes are well known,
has favoured me with a written communication on this
subject, from which I extract some passages, with his
permission.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c017'>"... It is my habit to separate myself from the verses I
have written before finishing them, and to leave them for some
time in the drawers of my writing-table. I even forget them
sometimes, when the piece has seemed to me a failure, and it
may happen to me to find them again several years after. I
then re-write them; and I have the power of calling up again,
with great clearness, the feeling which had suggested them.
This feeling I pose, so to speak, in my inner consciousness,
like a model which I am copying by means of the palette and
brush of language. This is the exact opposite of improvisation.
It seems to me that at such times I am working on the recollection
of an affective state.</p>

<p class='c017'>"When I remember the emotions aroused in me by the entry
of the Germans into Paris after our last defeats, I find it
impossible not to <em>experience this same emotion afresh</em>, simultaneously
and indivisibly; while the mnemonic image of the
Paris of that day remains in my memory very distinct from any
actual perception. When I remember the kind of affection
which, in my childhood, I felt for my mother, I find it impossible
not to become, in some sort, a child again, at the very moment
when I call up this memory—not to allow my heart of to-day
to participate in the former tenderness due to recollection.
I am almost inclined to ask myself if every <em>recollection of feeling
does not take on the character of a hallucination</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“When a student, I formed a connection in which I was
grossly deceived; so everyday an occurrence that the correctness
of my observations can probably be tested by most men
from their own recollections. There was nothing very deep in
my love, imagination being the principal factor, and I have long
ago forgiven the injury, which, after all, chiefly concerned my
vanity. Both rancour and affection vanished long ago. Under
these circumstances, if I call up the recollection, I recognise at
the outset that I am now a stranger to the feelings which I can
remember; but I soon notice that I only remain a stranger to
them so long as the memories are vague and confused. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>soon as, by an effort of recollection, I make them more precise,
they cease <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> to be memories only, and <em>I am quite
surprised to feel the movements of youthful passion and angry
jealousy renewed in me</em>. It is indeed only this revival which
could enable me to retouch the verses which this little adventure
of long-past years induced me to perpetrate, and to allow the
expression of my former feelings to benefit by the experience
acquired in my art.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Case 5. H—— (20 years). On the <em>memory</em> of the feeling of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span> experienced on the first day in barracks.—"In order to
<em>represent</em> to myself thoroughly this feeling of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span>, which was
very intense, and lasted a whole afternoon, I shut my eyes and
abstract my thoughts. I feel, first, a slight shiver down my
back, a certain <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malaise</i></span>, a feeling of something unpleasant
which I should prefer not to feel over again. After this first
moment comes a certain uncomfortable state, a slight oppression
of the throat; this feeling is connected with vague representations
which do not fix themselves. In the experiment
here described, I first picture to myself the barrack-yard, where
I used to walk; then this picture of the yard is replaced by that
of the dormitory on the third floor. I see myself seated at a
window, looking at the view, of which I can see all the details.
This, however, does not last; the picture soon disappears;
there remains only a vague idea of being seated at a window,
and then a feeling of oppression, weariness, dejection, and a
certain heaviness in the shoulders. At this point I break off
the experiment and open my eyes, still experiencing a general
sense of uneasiness, which soon passes off."</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>The whole experiment lasts a little more than ten minutes.
To sum up, we have, first, a feeling of weight and oppression,
a shudder in the back, but no clear representation of surrounding
objects; then a feeling of discomfort becoming
more and more intense, visual representations varying
either in their nature or their intensity; and finally, the
total disappearance of these visual representations, the
feeling of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span> being persistent throughout.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c017'>Case 6. A woman, aged 28. “Three years ago, I used
to go and see a relative who was undergoing treatment at an
establishment in the neighbourhood of P——. My visits were
very frequent, and always began with a long wait in a room
overlooking the garden. If I wish to repeat the impressions
of this time of waiting, which was always disagreeable to me,
all I have to do is to sit down in a chair, as I was then seated,
to close my eyes and put myself in the same frame of mind,
which I can do quite easily. Not half a minute passes between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the evocation and the clear and absolute reconstruction of the
scene. First, I feel the carpet under my feet, then I <em>see</em> its
pattern of red and brown roses; then the table with the books
lying on it, their colour and style of binding; then the windows,
and through them the branches of the trees, of which I hear
the sound as they beat against the glass; lastly, the peculiar
atmosphere of the room, its unmistakable smell. After this, I
feel over again all the weariness of waiting, complicated by an
intense dread of the doctor’s arrival, a state of apprehension
ending in a violent palpitation of the heart, which I find it
impossible to escape. When once I have entered on this
train of thought, I have to follow it out to the end, passing
through the whole series of states which I passed through at the
time. If I wished to eliminate any of them I am sure that I
could not do so, as when, in a dream, one tries, without ever
succeeding, to avoid an unpleasant fall which one foresees.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Here nothing is wanting, either the circumstances, or the
repetition of the emotion itself; and this case shows that
the complete revival of an emotion is the beginning of the
emotion itself.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lastly, there remains a third category of answers, of which
I have only four cases. I mention these merely as a
curiosity, and in order to omit nothing. These persons represent
the emotion <em>objectively</em> to themselves, by localising it
in another. One can only represent anger to himself under
the force of some particular angry man. Another incarnates
fear and hatred in a certain person whose countenance
or attitude expresses fear or hatred. The emotional state
is, for these, only represented under its bodily form.</p>

<p class='c017'>Is this because they have, personally, little experience of
these different emotions?</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>
<p class='c019'>This series of facts, with their multiform and often contradictory
manifestations, may perhaps leave the reader in
perplexity, which would be still greater were I to enumerate
all. Let us try to bring them into some sort of order, and
understand their significance.</p>

<p class='c017'>If—placing ourselves at the point of view of the question
stated above, the possibility of a revival not produced by
an actual occurrence—we propose to ourselves to classify
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>all images whatsoever, we shall see that they fall into these
groups, viz.:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Those of direct and easy revivability (visual, auditory,
tactile-motor, with some reservations for the last named).</p>

<p class='c017'>Those of indirect and comparatively easy revivability:
pleasures and pains, emotions. They are indirect, because
the emotional state is only induced through the intermediary
of the intellectual states with which it is associated.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c010'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Those of difficult revivability, either direct or indirect.
This heterogeneous and difficult group includes tastes,
odours, and internal sensations.</p>

<p class='c017'>What are the reasons for these differences? I reduce
them to two principal ones, which I may briefly state thus—</p>

<p class='c017'>The revivability of an impression is in direct ratio to
its complexity, and consequently in inverse ratio to its
simplicity.</p>

<p class='c017'>The revivability of an impression (with certain exceptions
to be mentioned afterwards) is in direct ratio to the motor
elements included in it.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. It is an incontestable fact that an isolated state of
consciousness, with no relation to what precedes, accompanies,
or follows it, has small chance of fixing itself in the
memory. I hear a word of an unknown language, it
immediately vanishes; but if I read and write it, if I
associate it with some object or with various circumstances,
it is fixed. It is easier to remember a group or a series than
an isolated and unrelated term. Now, by their very nature,
the visual images arrange themselves in complex aggregates,
and the auditive in sequences (or even, in the case of
harmony, in simultaneities), while the motor images are
associated in series, every term of which awakens and brings
with it the last. They accordingly fulfil the conditions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>immediate and easy revivability. It is the same with
pleasures, pains, emotions. Always connected with intellectual
states (perceptions, representations, or ideas), they
form part of an aggregate, and are involved in its resurgent
movement.</p>

<p class='c017'>The case is different with the images of our third group.
They are not associated with one another; they have an
isolated and individual character; they contract no relations,
either of space or time, among themselves.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us take the case of odours. One excludes another;
they are not associated in the imagination as visual images
are in the recollection of a beautiful landscape. One of
my correspondents is able to recall at will the scent of
pinks; she tried to do so while walking in a wood full of
decaying leaves and their smell, but without success; one
odour excluded the other. Neither can they be arranged
in sequences. I am aware that an English chemist, Piesse,
has claimed the ability to class scents in a continuous
series, like notes, patchouli corresponding to lower <i>c</i> in the
key of F, and civet to the upper <i>f</i> in the key of G—the
whole in tones and semitones; but no one, so far as I
know, has taken this fancy seriously.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the same way, tastes may be associated with other
images, as of hunger (I have collected several cases of this),
which makes their revival more difficult. Among themselves
they do not form associations, but combinations. If
associations ever occur they are extremely rare and limited
in character.</p>

<p class='c017'>Hunger and thirst are special, indecomposable states.
Disgust and fatigue are revived easily enough, and, as we
have seen, by almost every one; but it must be remembered
that these states are composed of somewhat heterogeneous—sensory
and motor—elements, and that they approach the
character of aggregates.</p>

<p class='c017'>This antithesis between the first two groups and that of
odours, tastes, and internal sensations, depends, no doubt,
on certain physiological conditions. As we can do nothing
but hazard conjectures on this point, it is better to abstain.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The second theory stated above—viz., that the revivability
is in direct ratio to the motor elements included in the
image—is more open to question. I only give it as a
<em>partial</em>, secondary, subsidiary explanation, applicable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>many cases but not to all, and allowing of numerous exceptions.
Since we have to do with an empirical law—a
pure generalisation from experience—we must test it by
facts, in order to fix its bearing and value. This rapid
examination will justify my restrictions and reservations.</p>

<p class='c017'>Among all our impressions, those of sight and hearing
are those most easily revived. Now, though the visual
faculty has at its disposal a very rich, varied, and delicate
motor apparatus, this is not the case with the auditory.
Considering the superior position of the latter among the
senses, it is very poor in motor elements; movements of
the head, accommodatory movements of the tympanal membrane,
in extreme cases movements of the vocal organs,
and, according to the latest hypotheses, a certain function of
the semi-circular canals. The difference between the two
senses in respect of motor elements is very striking.</p>

<p class='c017'>The sense of smell is much more varied and of greater
extent than that of taste. It is far superior as a means of
information, yet inferior as regards the sum of the movements
at its disposal for exercising itself.</p>

<p class='c017'>Pleasures, pains, and pleasurable or painful emotions, all
include motor elements. So much is evident, yet let us
remark what follows: if we divide the affective states—roughly,
yet sufficiently for our purpose—into two groups,
on one side pains and painful emotions, on the other
pleasures and pleasurable emotions, a difficulty presents
itself. The first group, that of the “asthenic” states, manifests
itself by a diminution of movements, circulation,
respiration, etc. The second group, that of the “sthenic”
states, manifests itself by the reverse phenomena, increased
movement, circulation, etc. Shall we say that the second
group, which contains more motor elements, is revived
more easily and more frequently than the first? The conclusion
would be logical, but contrary to experience. We
should even find, I believe, that the contrary opinion has
more supporters.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c010'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Organic sensations appear to depend principally on the
chemical action taking place in the organism; it is thus
with hunger, thirst, suffocation, disgust, fatigue, etc. Here
the part played by the motor element is but trifling. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>this revival is vague, this group seems to conform to the
law stated above.</p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up: when examined in detail our formula is
only a partial explanation, a generalisation of limited
application.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IV.</h4>
<p class='c019'>We have now arrived at the principal question, for which
all that has hitherto been said was only a preparation: Is
there such a thing as a real revival of impressions?
Although most psychologists do not put this question
at all, or only treat it in a cursory manner, the majority
of answers are certainly in the negative. It is maintained
that we remember the conditions and circumstances of an
emotional occurrence, but not the emotional state itself.</p>

<p class='c017'>I feel obliged completely to reject this theory, which
would never have been maintained if the subject had not
been treated <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>, in an offhand manner, without
sufficient observations. A closer study, supported by the
facts which I have adduced, and others which will follow,
shows that there are two quite distinct cases. Some people
have a <em>false</em> or <em>abstract</em> memory for feelings, others a <em>true</em>
or <em>concrete</em> one. In the former the image is scarcely revived,
or not at all; in others it is revived in great part, or totally.
In order the better to explain the difference between these
two forms of memory, let us examine the constituent
elements and the mechanism of each separately.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The <em>false</em> or <em>abstract</em> memory of feeling consists in the
representation of an occurrence, <em>plus</em> an affective characteristic—I
do not say an affective state. This is certainly
the most frequent form. What remains of the small
incidents of a long journey but the recollection of the
places where they happened, the details, and the fact that
they <em>were once</em> disagreeable. What remains of a vanished
love-affair but the impression of a person, of attentions paid
to her, of adventures, and, besides, the recollection that
this <em>was once</em> happiness? How much does the adult retain
of the memory of his childish games? How much of his
former religious or political belief remains to a person who
has become totally indifferent? In all cases of this kind,
and there are thousands, the remembered emotional characteristic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>is <em>known</em>, not felt or experienced; this is only an
additional intellectual character. It is added to the rest as
an accessory; pretty much as, in picturing to ourselves a
town, a monument, a landscape visited long ago, we add the
recollection of a bright or cloudy sky, of rain or fog which
surrounded it.</p>

<p class='c017'>I call an emotional memory “abstract,” and I justify this
term. Emotional states are just as susceptible of abstraction
and generalisation as intellectual states. One who has seen
many men, who has heard many dogs bark or frogs croak,
forms to himself a generic image of the human figure, of
the barking of dogs, or the croaking of frogs. This is a
schematic, half-abstract, half-concrete representation, formed
through the accumulation of rough resemblances and the
elimination of differences. In the same way, a person who
has several times suffered from toothache, colic, or headache,
who has had paroxysms of anger or fear, hate or love, forms
to himself a generic impression of these different states by
means of the same procedure. This is the first step. It
would be beside the point to follow here in detail the
ascending progress of the mind to higher and ever higher
generalisations. In their highest degree, concepts like
force, movement, quantity, etc., suppose two things: a
word which fixes and represents them, and a potential
or latent knowledge, hidden under the word and preventing
it from being a mere <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>flatus vocis</i></span>. He who does not possess
this potential knowledge, who is incapable of resolving the
superior abstractions, first into medium, then into inferior
ones, then into concrete <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>data</i></span>, possesses only an empty
concept. So for the affective states the terms emotion,
passion, sensibility, etc., are nothing but abstractions, and
in order to verify these terms and give them a real
significance, we must have experiences in the region of
feeling, concrete data. People who speak of a state of
feeling which they have never experienced, which they
know only by hearsay, have an empty concept. States of
feeling are a material susceptible of all degrees of abstraction,
like sensory material.</p>

<p class='c017'>The false or abstract memory of feeling is only a sign, a
simulacrum, a substitute for the real occurrence, an intellectualised
state added to the purely intellectual elements
of the impression, and nothing more.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>2. The true or concrete memory of impressions consists
in the <em>actual</em> reproduction of a former state of feeling, with
all its characteristics. This is necessary—at least in theory—if
it is to be complete. The nearer it approaches to
totality, the more accurate it is. Here the recollection does
not consist merely in the representation of conditions and
circumstances, in short, of intellectual states, but in the
revival of the state of feeling itself as such, <i>i.e.</i>, as <em>felt</em>. I
have already given instances of this: Fouillée’s experiment,
the cases of Littré and Sully-Prudhomme; those numbered
III. and IV., so clear and precise, show that a true memory
of impressions, independent of its intellectual accompaniment,
is no chimera.</p>

<p class='c017'>Bain says that the emotions, “in their strict character of
emotions proper, have the minimum of revivability; but
being always incorporated with the sensations of the higher
senses, they share in the superior revivability of sights and
sounds.” On which Professor W. James makes the following
comment: "But he fails to point out that the revival of
sights and sounds may be <em>ideal</em> without ceasing to be
distinct; whilst the emotion, to be distinct, must become
real again. Professor Bain seems to forget that an ‘ideal
emotion,’ and a real emotion prompted by an ideal object,
are two very different things."<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c010'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>I maintain, on the contrary, that we have here only two
different stages of the same thing; the first ineffectual and
abortive, the second complete; and the subject which now
occupies us must either have been in a very confused
state, or very negligently treated, for a clear mind like that
of W. James not to have seen that affective memories, like
others, aim at becoming actual states of feeling. We ought
not, however, to forget the indisputable fact that our consciousness
only exists in the present. For a recollection,
however distant, to exist, as far as I am concerned, it must
re-enter the narrow area of <em>present</em> consciousness; otherwise
it is buried in the depths of the unconscious and equivalent
to the non-existent. We have thus (not to speak of the
present-future) a present-present and a present-past—viz.,
that of memory; and this is only distinguished from the
other by certain additional marks which it is needless to
enumerate, but which consist principally in its appearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>like an initial state, though, in general, less intense. Now
these indispensable conditions of memory are the same
for both intellectual and emotional states. If, with my eyes
shut, I can call up the vision of St. Peter’s at Rome (if I
were an architect, with a good visual memory, I should see
it in all its details), my impression is an <em>actual</em> one, and only
becomes a memory by the addition of secondary characteristics,
such as repetition and a lower degree of intensity. The
two cases are similar; in both, the revived impression,
according to the law formulated by Dugald Stewart and
Taine, is accompanied by a momentary belief which places
it in the position of an actual reality. But the recollection
of a feeling, it will be said, has this special property, that it
is associated with organic and physiological states which
make of it a real emotion. I reply that it <em>must</em> be so, for
an emotion which does not vibrate through the whole body is
nothing but a purely intellectual state. To expect that we
should actually revive a state of feeling without reviving also
its organic conditions, is to expect the impossible, to state
the problem in contradictory terms. We should, in that
case, simply have its substitute, its abstraction, <i>i.e.</i>, the
false affective memory which is a variety of intellectual
memory; the emotion will be <i>re</i>cognised, not <i>re</i>vived.</p>

<p class='c017'>Finally, the ideal of every recollection is that, while
keeping its character of being already experienced, it should
be adequate in such measure as was possible for the original
impression. The revival of impressions is an internal
operation, whose extreme form is hallucination. For the
two forms of memory, intellectual and emotional, the ideal
is the same, only each has its special mechanism for
realising it.</p>

<p class='c017'>There are all possible degrees of transition from the
simple bald representation of the words pleasure or pain,
love or fear, to the acute, fully and entirely felt representation
of these states. In a crowd of people taken at random,
one might, with the help of adequate information, determine
all the intermediate degrees, from the abstract to the
concrete. Still more, these may be met with in the same
individual. When the poet says that “Sadness departs
upon the wings of Time,” his meaning, in psychological
language, is that the affective memory is gradually transformed
into an intellectual memory. We know that certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>artists, in order to get rid of the memory of a sorrow or a
passion, have fixed it in a work of art. This was Goethe’s
method; every one knows the story of <cite>Werther</cite>, to quote
but one example. One of my correspondents employs the
same procedure with success; <i>i.e.</i>, in the case we are dealing
with, the question is how to transfer emotion to the region
of the imagination, and, consequently, intellectualise it.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have said that in certain persons the revival of
emotional states seems to be complete. Is it so in fact?
I believe that it is impossible to give a precise answer to this
question; and here we have a point where the emotional
memory differs from the intellectual memory.</p>

<p class='c017'>A given recollection is considered accurate; but in the
majority of cases this is only an illusion. Nearly always, in
revived impressions, there are deductions and losses, sometimes
additions; sometimes they include <em>plus</em>, sometimes
<em>minus</em> factors. At any rate, in the intellectual order,
there are certain cases where one can say that the recollection
is perfect, without the least gap or error; and this
affirmation is legitimate because verifiable. It is quite
sufficient to compare the copy with the original. If I enter
a hall of the Alhambra with my eyes closed, I can ascertain
whether the inner vision which I have retained from a
former visit is adequate to the reality. I can check my
recollection of a passage of music by the actual hearing of
the same. The painter mentioned by Wigan who executed
his portraits from memory, Mozart reconstructing Allegri’s
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Miserere</cite></span>, are the classic examples of perfect cases where the
impression is revived with irreproachable exactitude.</p>

<p class='c017'>But in the region of the feelings this comparison is impossible,
because two subjective states, of which one is the
original and one the copy, cannot co-exist in the same
individual, and because the primary impression cannot be
objectivised. I see but one way of getting over the difficulty
so as to arrive at an approximately correct answer.
This would consist in comparing the revived emotional state
with a written document dating from the moment of the
first impression; and even this impression is open to doubt.
J. J. Rousseau, speaking of the enthusiasm aroused by the
love-letters of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Nouvelle Héloïse</cite></span>, tells us that they were
inspired by his own love for Madame d’Houdetot, and
adds, “What would they have said could they have read the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>originals!” It is possible that Rousseau was more or less
mistaken; but this is a comparison of the kind I am
suggesting. A correspondent, well equipped for psychological
observations, and accustomed to note down the day’s
impressions, had promised me to attempt such a comparison
between the actual recollection and the written document;
but various causes have prevented the accomplishment of
this purpose. One might possibly, without much trouble,
chance to recover a letter written under the impression of
the moment, and compare it with the present emotional
recollection which, rightly or wrongly, we consider most
correct. For my part, I am inclined to doubt whether, in
the case of feelings, there is ever a complete correspondence
between the original and the copy; but this is merely a
hypothetical view.</p>

<p class='c017'>It still remains to say a few words on forgetfulness in the
region of the emotions. Affective amnesia is found in two
forms—one pathological, the other normal.</p>

<p class='c017'>I pass over in silence the morbid manifestations,
whose study would be both extensive and curious, but
would lead me away from my principal aim, which is a
practical one. We find numerous examples of the loss of
altruistic, moral, or religious feelings, of partial or total
indifference to the past, of complete insensibility—the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Gemütslosigkeit</i></span> of the German alienists.</p>

<p class='c017'>I confine myself to the consideration of affective amnesia
under its simplest and most widely-known form. Nothing
is more frequently met with. In the first place, the single
fact that most psychologists either neglect or deny the
phenomenon of emotional memory, constitutes a presumption
that its function is not a very obvious one. Moreover,
that emotional memory which I have designated the false or
abstract one, may, without prejudice, be considered as a
mitigated form of forgetfulness. Finally, eliminating the
non-emotional temperaments as irrelevant to our subject,
we may find, even among the emotional, many who
feel acutely, but do not retain their emotions. Every
one knows people whose whole nature is shaken by sorrow,
joy, love, indignation; they seem for a long time as if possessed;
a few weeks later, not a trace remains. Emotions
glide off their minds as a thunder-shower does off the roofs.
Now this affective amnesia has a great influence on conduct.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Here, in fact, are two general truths derived from experience,
and in my opinion incontestable:—</p>

<p class='c017'>On the one hand, pleasant and painful sensations are
the most powerful, if not the only motive forces of human
activity.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the other, there are people in whom emotions are
revived strongly, weakly, or not at all.</p>

<p class='c017'>The conclusion is that the portion of individual experience
resulting from the pleasures and pains experienced,
will show itself, as to its efficacy, strongly, feebly, or not at
all, according to the individual. The prodigal who has
ruined himself and is restored to opulence by an unexpected
chance, if he has not preserved a lively recollection of his
privations, will begin his extravagant career over again; if
his painful recollections are of a stable character, they will
act on his natural tendencies as a restraining or inhibitory
force. The drunkard and the glutton will not repeat their
excesses as long as the impression of the after-effects remains
vivid. The educator, as every one knows, has no hold over
a child on whom the recollection of rewards and punishments
has no effect. I have already mentioned the state of
mind which frequently succeeds dangerous confinements;
this, again, is a case of affective amnesia. The absence of
sympathy, in many men, is only an incapacity for reviving
the recollection of the ills they have suffered themselves,
and consequently for feeling them in others. These are
well-known facts, of which it is needless to lengthen the
list; but however well known they may be, their psychological
reason is, in my opinion, not always apprehended,
because the importance of the emotional memory has not
been recognised.</p>

<p class='c017'>Affective amnesia, therefore, plays a much more important
part in human life than we are apt to think. It often lets us
into the secret of strange modes of action, though I would
not assert that it <em>alone</em> is sufficient to explain these everywhere
and always.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>V.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The study just made seems to me to lead to the following
conclusions:—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. There exists an <span class='fss'>AFFECTIVE TYPE</span> as clear and well-defined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>as the visual, the auditory, and the motor types.
It consists in the easy, complete, and preponderant revival
of affective <a id='corr167.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='impressions'>impressions.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_167.3'><ins class='correction' title='impressions'>impressions.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c017'>I have simply applied to an almost unexplored region of
memory the methods of research inaugurated for objective
sensations by Taine and Galton, continued by many others,
and successful in their hands. It will, perhaps, be objected
that the complete emotional type is rarely found; but neither
is it certain that the visual, auditory, and motor types are of
very frequent occurrence in a pure state. This, however, is
of little consequence, the essential point being to determine
its existence. Those who belong to this type will easily
recognise it. I foresee that those whose memories are of
the opposite type will refuse to admit it; but the members
of the Royal Society and the Académie des Sciences,—being
for the most part possessed of non-visual memories,—when
questioned by Galton, failed to understand his queries,
and would probably have rejected his conclusions. Many
men have an incurable tendency to wish that every one
were constituted like themselves, and to refuse to admit
the existence of any departures from their type. Yet in
psychology, even more than elsewhere, we must be distrustful
of too extensive generalisations.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. There exists not only a general emotional type; it
admits of varieties, and it is even probable that <em>partial</em>
types are the most frequent. Here I note a resemblance
between my researches and those made with regard to
impressions of objective origin. It is known that some
persons have an excellent memory for faces, figures, concrete
objects, but not for colours or visual signs, such as
printing and writing. Others have an excellent memory for
languages but none for music, or inversely. Moreover, have
not numerous pathological phenomena demonstrated the fact
that, in a determinate category of images, a whole group
may disappear, without appreciable injury to the rest?</p>

<p class='c017'>I have not at present a sufficient supply of documents to
enter on the study of the varieties of the affective type; but
it is certain that they exist; that, for some, a clear and
frequent revival only takes place in the case of pleasurable
impressions; in others, of gloomy or of erotic images. I
have obtained conclusive affirmative answers on this point,
but will only transcribe a case which deals with fear.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c017'>Case 7. "I am not what would be called a general emotional
type, but I have a special emotional memory—that of fear, which
in me is very pronounced.... I have had in my life, like every
one else, many joyful moments; I will frankly say that, when I
remember those incidents in my life which have caused me
great joy, I feel no joy whatever. Besides, it is very difficult to
recall the moments in which I felt joyful, or even the incidents
which produced my joy—probably because the representative
memory has not been reinforced by the emotional memory. I
do not know how this may be, and do not attempt to draw any
inferences from my own case. I am only speaking of myself.</p>

<p class='c017'>"I have tried to recall one of the moments in my life when
I had the acutest sense of joy—it was in April 1888. [Here
follows a long description of honours obtained by the author at
the age of twenty, and the applause—unexpected at his age—of
a numerous public assembly.] I have a clear and very accurate
recollection of the incidents I have just been describing; I can
remember the cause to which, rightly or wrongly, I attributed
my success; I could repeat nearly every word I said on that
occasion; I could remember (though not so easily) the hall and
the faces of the audience; but I find, to-day, no joy whatever in
thinking of all this.</p>

<p class='c017'>"As regards my capacity for reviving sad recollections the
same may be said as in the case of joyfulness.</p>

<p class='c017'>"To return to fear. I have two very conclusive examples of
special emotional memory. When a boarder at the S—— <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>lycée</i></span>
at Bucharest, I dreaded all the staff of the institution on account
of a punishment they were in the habit of inflicting on me—that
of confinement to the schoolroom on holidays. I remember
having such a fear of this imprisonment that, once
I had left the building, it was with great difficulty I could bring
myself to pass the gateway, for fear of being stopped. In later
years, having finished my studies, and kept up friendly relations
with all persons concerned, I used sometimes to return on a
visit to the Lycée, but never without feeling a kind of terrified
shudder on my entrance.</p>

<p class='c017'>"More than this: having remained three years at Paris, without
visiting my own country, I returned to Bucharest, and went
to see a new director, with whom I was on friendly terms.
Even then, when approaching the door of the institution, I felt
a sort of uneasiness which was nothing else but my old dread in
an attenuated form.</p>

<p class='c017'>"In the first year of my stay at Paris I entered my name for
the more advanced lectures of the Lycée L——. I only attended
them for a week. In the class-room I was conscious of an
uneasy feeling; I feared something without knowing what it
was; I felt a horror of all the staff, though they were full of
consideration for me, and at my age (twenty-two) I was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>longer on the footing of a schoolboy. What could I have been
afraid of? for I might have left whenever I wished it. Though
accustomed to work for many hours together in libraries, I could
do nothing in this class-room. I believe this state to have been
a reminiscence of my old fear—that of the Bucharest <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>lycée</i></span>....
Long afterwards, when a student attending the lectures of the
Faculté de Droit, I had every day to pass the Lycée L——.
I would hurry past it as quickly as I could, feeling the same
dread as at the time when I used to pass the gateway of the
Bucharest <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>lycée</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have a good motor, no visual, and a very slight auditory
memory.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>It might be said that in this case the revival is often
artificially produced, and associated with special circumstances;
but it seemed to me of too clear and definite a
character to be omitted.</p>

<p class='c017'>I need not point out that these individual differences in
the revivability of emotional states certainly play a great
part in the constitution of different types of character.
Moreover, the existence of variations of the emotional type
cuts short the question, acrimoniously debated by some
writers, whether pains can be more easily remembered
than pleasures. Optimists and pessimists have fought
fiercely over this phantasmal problem; but it is a vain and
factitious question so long as we suppose that it admits of
but one solution. There is not, and cannot be, a general
answer.</p>

<p class='c017'>Certain individuals revive joyful images with astonishing
facility; sad memories, when they arise, are immediately
and easily trodden down. I know an inveterate optimist,
successful in all his undertakings, who has much difficulty
in picturing to himself the few reverses that he has experienced.
“I remember joys much more easily than painful
states” is an answer I frequently meet with in my notes.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the other hand, there are many who say, “I remember
sorrows much more easily than pleasurable states.” In
the course of my inquiries I have found that the latter
are the most numerous; but I do not see my way to
draw any conclusion from this fact. One says, “I find it
much easier to revive unpleasant feelings, whence my
tendency to pessimism. Joyous impressions are evanescent.
A painful recollection makes me sad at a joyful moment;
a joyful recollection does not cheer me at a sad one.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>These are straightforward cases. Outside them the
question above stated can only be solved at haphazard,
and by a merely mental view.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. Revivability depends on cerebral and internal conditions
(whatever these may be, known or unknown)
rather than on the primary impression itself. To feel
emotions acutely and revive them acutely are two widely
different operations; one does not imply the other. We
have seen that, in many cases, revivability even seems to be
in inverse ratio to the intensity of the initial phenomenon.
This brings us back to the question of characters. It does
not matter whether the impression is a vivid one; what
is wanted is that it should be fixed. Often it is heightened
by a process of latent incubation depending on individual
temperament. Chateaubriand, speaking of a
gamekeeper to whom he was much attached, and who
was killed by a poacher, says, “My imagination (at sixteen)
pictured to me Raulx holding his entrails in his hands,
and dragging himself to the hut where he died. I conceived
the idea of revenge; I wished to fight the
murderer. In this respect I am singularly constituted;
at the moment of a blow I scarcely feel it, but it engraves
itself on my memory; <em>the recollection, instead of being
weakened, grows stronger with time</em>; it sleeps in my heart
for years together, then the most trivial circumstance
awakens it with renewed force, and my wound becomes
more painful than on the first day.”<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c010'><sup>[107]</sup></a> Here we have
another analogy with what takes place in the order of
objective impressions. It is not sufficient to have good
eyes in order to have a good visual memory, and I
know short-sighted persons whose inner vision is excellent.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c010'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>I may terminate this inquiry, which is a sketch rather
than a study of the subject, by reminding the reader that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the facts ascertained for the other, the intellectual part
of memory, have not been the work of one man or of one
day.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c010'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

hereditary unconsciousness; personal unconsciousness

Function of the conscious feelings: accidental cases,
permanent cases, exceptional or rare cases.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>In this chapter we have still to deal with the relation
between the feelings and the memory, but under quite
another form, seeing that we have to study the feelings as a
<em>cause</em>. Instead of establishing, as we have hitherto done,
that there is such a thing as a real memory of the feelings,
our present aim is to determine the function of states of
feeling in the recalling of recollections and the association
of ideas. Their importance as a hidden factor of revivability
has been recognised by several contemporary writers,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c010'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
some even having a tendency to exaggerate it.</p>

<p class='c017'>We know that the theory of the association of ideas has
been reduced to two fundamental laws—that of contiguity
and that of resemblance. I may remark, without insisting
on the fact, that they are not of the same nature; the first,
being purely mechanical, the result of experience, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>second supposes, in addition to this, a certain degree of
mental labour, for a complete correspondence between two
states is rarely met with, and can only be grasped in
consequence of a dissociation or abstraction operating on
the raw materials. These two laws are purely intellectual;
they are regulative principles deduced from facts, nothing
more. They are rather descriptive than explanatory. They
reveal the mechanism, but not the motive force. They
suppose something beyond, unless we admit that ideas are
psychic atoms endowed with some mysterious attraction or
affinity. With regard to the determining reasons, they are
dumb. Now it cannot be doubted that in many cases
(not all) the cause of the association is to be found in a
permanent or momentary state of the feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'>The writers who have pointed out this influence (often
efficacious though latent) have conceived this superior law,
which might be called the Law of Feeling, in two different
ways, some as absolute and universal, others as partial and
local. I take my stand among the latter.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Fouillée (as also, it seems, Horwicz) has maintained
the former thesis. “The association of ideas presupposes that
of the emotions, and, with the latter, that of the impulses.
The dominant impulse awakens, by association, the secondary
impulses tending in the same direction. The tie which
unites them is the unity of an aim in relation to which the
impulses are medium, the unity of an effect in relation to
which they are co-operating forces.... The laws of association
and contrast are what dominate the association of the
feelings” (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 221). I shall not be suspected of
hostility to the essential spirit of this thesis, since the
present work is only one long vindication of the primordial
nature of tendencies. But unless we are led astray by
the mirage of unity at any price, it is impossible to admit
that <cite>every</cite> association supposes an emotional factor as a
determining reason. Not to speak of the numerous cases
resulting from contiguity, in which the part played by the
feelings is very doubtful, I find an important category of
purely intellectual associations, where the intervention of
the feelings appears to me impossible to verify. Is it
likely that the mathematician and the metaphysician who
connect together a long series of abstractions have an
emotional state as the support and vehicle of their thought,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>whether the latter be discursive or constructive? I do not
see, in theory or in fact, any reason for admitting this,
unless we wish to involve the love of truth; and in any case
this would only be a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>primum movens</i></span>, not the direct and
immediate cause of the associations.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The influence of emotional states must be stated as a
principal, but not an exclusive cause. It is summed up in
what Shadworth Hodgson has called the “Law of Interest.”
In a past event, everything is not equally interesting; in its
revival, all the elements are not equally active, the most
emotional bringing the others with them. “Two processes
are constantly going on in redintegrations. The one a
process of corrosion, melting, decay; the other a process
of renewing, arising, becoming.... Those parts of the
object, however, which possess an interest, resist this
tendency to gradual decay of the whole object.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c010'><sup>[111]</sup></a> Coleridge
rightly says that “The true practical general law of association
is this: that whatever makes certain parts of a total
impression more vivid or distinct than the rest will determine
the mind to recall these, in preference to others
equally linked together by the common condition of contemporaneity
or continuity. But the will itself, by confining
and intensifying the attention, may arbitrarily give vividness
or distinctness to any object whatsoever.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c010'><sup>[112]</sup></a> The power
attributed by Coleridge to the attention and the will finally
resolves itself into an emotional state as ultimate cause, and
from it alone can an increase of intensity be derived.</p>

<p class='c017'>I shall insist no further on these generalities, as it will be
more instructive to determine by means of a few details the
influence of the emotional life on the memory. To this
end I shall divide our study into two parts, the function of
unconscious feeling, and that of the conscious feelings.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>It is not always easy to determine positively the degree
in which unconscious feeling influences the memory in order
to awaken it, or to connect ideas with one another. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>purposely employed the vague term “unconscious feeling”
as prejudging nothing with regard to its nature. We may
form any conception we like of it, either considering it as
purely physiological or assigning to it a psychological character—that
of a consciousness diminishing to infinity. Both
these opinions have their partisans, but this does not matter
as regards the following considerations. In this unconscious
feeling I distinguish three strata, passing from the deepest
upwards, from the more obscure to the less obscure.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Hereditary or ancestral unconsciousness. I mention
this merely for the sake of completeness. It would consist
in the influence of certain modes of feeling, inherited and
fixed in a race, which might, without our knowing it, exercise
some sway over our associations. Under this form, at least,
it appears to me extremely hypothetical. Laycock<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c010'><sup>[113]</sup></a> (1844),
one of the founders of the physiology of the unconscious,
attempts to explain by this means certain national and
individual tastes; the Hungarians are supposed to like
plains because these appeal to the ancestral recollection of
the Mongolian steppes, their primæval home. Herbert
Spencer, who, however, has not occupied himself much
with the influence of sentiments on the association of ideas,
says incidentally that, in the impression produced by a
landscape, “along with the immediate sensations, there are
partially excited the myriads of sensations that have been in
time past received from objects such as those presented;
further, there are also excited certain deeper, but now vague
combinations of states which were organised in the race
during barbarous times, when its pleasurable activities were
chiefly among the woods and waters.”<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c010'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Schneider assumes
this ancestral revivification in every æsthetic perception.
We shall return to this subject in Part II. The predatory
tastes of primitive man would explain certain agreeable
associations (<i>e.g.</i>, the pleasure of constructing a bloodthirsty
drama) which contrast with the habits of civilised man.</p>

<p class='c017'>These facts seem to me reducible to a single explanation.
There are in every man latent tendencies, which may remain
latent throughout his life, but may also be awakened and
revealed by some accidental occurrence. They might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>called hereditary, since they are found in an inherited
organism; but it would be quite as correct to call them
innate. In any case, it is very difficult to prove that they
are a survival, and above all a resurrection of once existing
tendencies.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Personal unconsciousness arising from cœnæsthesia,
<i>i.e.</i>, from the internal sensations collectively. This imperceptibly
brings us down to consciousness, from the
moment when the affective state can be verified without
induction. A certain disposition, a certain manner of feeling,
is the direct and immediate cause of association. It is
permanent or transitory. If permanent, it answers to the
temperament or disposition. As the subject is cheerful,
melancholy, erotic, or ambitious, an unconscious selection
is exercised on the ideas arising in consciousness; an artist
and a practical man, in face of the same object, have two
totally distinct modes of association. If transitory, it corresponds,
in the same individual, to states of health and
sickness, to changes of age; each one of these distinct
states produces a distinct selection. The unity of certain
dreams, in spite of the apparent difference of associations,
has its easily discovered cause in an organic or affective
disposition—fatigue, depression, oppression, circulatory or
digestive troubles, sexual excitement. The simplicity and
frequency of these facts will permit us to dispense with
insisting upon them.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. Personal unconsciousness, a residuum of affective
states connected with anterior perceptions, or with events
of our life. This emotional residuum, although latent,
is no less active, and can be recovered by analysis. This
case, one of the most important connected with our
subject, has recently been studied by Lehmann<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c010'><sup>[115]</sup></a> under the
name of displacement (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Verschiebung</i></span>) of the sentiments, and
by Sully under the name of <em>transference</em> of feelings; this
second denomination seems to me the clearer and more
accurate of the two.</p>

<p class='c017'>Under its most general form—for its mechanism is not
always the same—the law of transference consists in <em>directly</em>
attributing a sentiment to an object which does not itself
cause it. There is no transference in the sense that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>feeling is detached from the primary event in order to be
connected with another; but there is a moment of generalisation
or extension of the sentiment, which spreads like a
drop of oil. This transference can be symbolically represented.
Let us represent an intellectual state by A, and
by <i>s</i> the affective state which accompanies it; A by association
excites B, C, D, E, etc., while <i>s</i> is successively
transferred to B, C, D, E, etc. Thus we have, first,
<span class='division'><span class='under'>A</span><br /><i>s</i></span>, B, C, D, E, etc., then <span class='division'><span class='under'>A,B,C,D,E, etc.</span><br /><i>s</i></span>, so that C, D,
or E can directly produce <i>s</i> quite as A can, and even
without the assistance of A. “The feeling is excited
without the mediacy of the particular presentative element of
which it was originally a concomitant” (Sully).<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c010'><sup>[116]</sup></a> This law
of transfer is of sufficient importance to delay us a little,
because it plays a somewhat important part in the formation
of complex emotions, and we shall need to recall it
more than once. Besides, it does not always operate in
the same manner. I distinguish two principal cases,
according as the transfer is the result of contiguity, or of
resemblance.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Transference by Contiguity.</i>—When intellectual states have
co-existed and formed a complex by contiguity, and one of
them has been accompanied by a special sentiment, any
one of these states has a tendency to excite the same
sentiment.</p>

<p class='c017'>We can find numerous and simple examples in common
life. The lover transfers the sentiment at first called forth
by the person of his mistress to her clothes, her furniture,
her house. For the same reason, hatred and jealousy vent
their rage on inanimate objects belonging to the enemy.
In absolute monarchies the reverence in which the king’s
person is held is transferred to the throne, to the emblems
of his power, to everything directly or indirectly connected
with his person. The following charming passage from
Herbert Spencer relates to a less simple case of the same
nature: “The cawing of rooks is not in itself an agreeable
sound; musically considered, it is very much the contrary.
Yet the cawing of rooks usually produces pleasurable
feelings—feelings which many suppose to result from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>quality of the sound itself. Only the few who are given
to self-analysis are aware that the cawing of rooks is agreeable
to them because it has been connected with countless
of their greatest gratifications—with the gathering of wild
flowers in childhood; with Saturday afternoon excursions
in schoolboy days; with midsummer holidays in
the country, when books were thrown aside and lessons
were replaced by games and adventures in the field; with
fresh, sunny mornings, in after years, when a walking
excursion was an immense relief from toil. As it is, this
sound, though not causally related to all these multitudinous
and varied past delights, but only often associated with them,
rouses a dim consciousness of these delights; just as the
voice of an old friend, unexpectedly coming into the house,
suddenly raises a wave of that feeling which has resulted
from the pleasures of past companionship.” We must
remark that in the transfer by contiguity, which, by its
very nature is automatic, the intellectual states act as
<em>causes</em>, since the extension of the sentiment is subordinated
to them.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Transference by Resemblance.</i>—When an intellectual state
has been accompanied by a vivid sentiment, every similar or
analogous state tends to excite the same feeling.</p>

<p class='c017'>In this psychological fact lies the secret of the emotion of
love, tenderness, antipathy, respect, which we feel towards a
person at first sight, without apparent reason, and which we
are apt to put down to the account of instinct. But those
who devote themselves to the analysis of their own consciousness
will discover, in many cases, a more or less close
resemblance to a person who inspires, or has inspired, us
with love, tenderness, antipathy, or respect. A mother may
feel a sudden sympathy for a young man who is like her
dead son, or even merely of the same age. The explanation
of many of these cases lies in an unconscious state which is
not easy to seize, but which, if it returns to consciousness
(a process in which the will is only very indistinctly
concerned), elucidates everything. There are also so-called
instinctive fears, without conscious motives, which, by going
a little below the surface, can be referred to the same explanation.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c010'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>This transfer can take place in two ways, one narrow, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>other broad. The narrow method rests on resemblance
only: B resembles A, the perception or representation of
whom is or was accompanied by a certain feeling; the
transfer goes no further. The broader method rests on
analogy, and has a much wider scope; it passes from one
individual to several—to a class or classes. “A friend of
mine,” says Lehmann, “hated dogs; circumstances forced
him to keep one; he attached himself to this animal, and
gradually his feeling of sympathy spread to the whole
canine race” (<i>loc. cit.</i>). This possibility of a limited transfer
has been a social and moral factor of the first importance;
it has allowed of the extension of the sympathetic sentiments
from the small exclusive clan to more and more
distant groups—the tribe, the nation, the human race.
The wider transfer has been the great agent of the
transition from particularism to universalism.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c010'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>From the unconscious states to the affective states, of
which the subject is fully conscious, the transition is made
gradually and through doubtful forms; but whether obscure,
semi-obscure, or clear, their influence remains the same.
Among the numerous cases in which the association of
ideas depends on a conscious affective disposition we may
distinguish three groups:—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Individual, accidental, ephemeral cases. These can
be reduced to a single formula: when two or more states
of consciousness have been accompanied by the same
emotional state, they tend to be associated with one
another. Emotional resemblance unites and intertwines
disparate impressions. It is a case of association by
resemblance, <cite>but not intellectual</cite>; impressions are associated
because they resemble one another in a common emotional
colouring, not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>qua</i></span> impressions. Examples of this are
abundant. L. Ferri (in his <i>Psychologie de l’Association</i>,
where, by-the-bye, he does not note this emotional law) tells
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>us that one day, being stung by a fly, he suddenly
remembered a child seen by him, long ago, when himself
very young, on its death-bed. Whence this sudden vision?
“In the first place, I was lying on my bed, then I had
been stung by a fly, and lastly, the sight of the corpse had
caused in me a deep sadness, while, at this same moment,
I also happened to be very sad.” Association through
emotional identity or resemblance is of frequent occurrence
in dreams, as has been already said. I remember, among
many others, a dream whose unity, in spite of the apparent
incoherence of the association, was due to a general sense
of fatigue. A road without milestones stretched before me,
of which I was about to complete the last stage; steep
mountains kept rising one behind another; my eyes were
wearied with trying to catch sight of the longed-for town on
the horizon; and every time I wished to inquire the way I
had to speak a foreign language which I understand but
imperfectly, and in which it is very difficult for me to
express myself. I awoke, feeling a general aching and
heaviness of all the limbs. Sully relates a dream whose
unity consisted in a sense of anxiety and vexation. He was
suddenly called upon to give a lecture on Herder; he
began by stammering out some generalities; then he was
addressed by one of his audience, who suggested difficulties
to him; then the entire assembly broke up tumultuously.
One of his children, who had seen, for the first time, the
great clock at Strasburg, and, after an interval of two days,
the Swiss glaciers, dreamed on the following night that the
figures of the clock were walking about on the snow. In
this case the groundwork of the dream is a feeling of
admiration or surprise.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Permanent and stable cases; to be met with
everywhere, because involved in the structure of the
human mind. They are fixed in language. When
dealing with the expression of the emotions (Chap. IX.)
we met with “the principle of association of analogous
sensations,” formulated by Wundt. Adapting it to our
present subject, we may say that sensations imbued with
a similar emotional colouring are easily associated, and
strengthen each other. Nothing can differ more in nature
than our external sensations (except smell and taste), and
the qualities which they make known to us; the data of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>sight and hearing have no resemblance to one another as
cognitions of the external world, yet we speak of sombre
voices, clear voices, screaming colours, coloured music.
We associate sight with thermal sensations, as when we
speak of warm or cold colours. Taste also has its share—bitter
reproaches, subacid criticism. Finally, touch, as
Sully-Prudhomme has remarked, is perhaps the most
abundant source of associations between the idea of the
physical sensation and an emotional state; compare the
terms touching, hard, tender, heavy, firm, solid, harsh,
penetrating, poignant, piquant, etc. At the bottom of all
these associations there is a common emotional colouring
which both causes and supports them. Perhaps it would
be more accurate to class them among the cases of semi-conscious
emotional influence; but we have already said
that our division into conscious and unconscious factors is
superficial and of no great importance.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. Exceptional and rare cases. Flournoy, in his important
work on “coloured hearing,” rightly explains this anomaly
by “emotional association.” We know that several hypotheses
on the origin and cause of this phenomenon have
been constructed. On the embryological one, it would be
the result of an incomplete differentiation between the sense
of sight and that of hearing; a survival, we are told, from a
primitive epoch when this state was the rule. On the
anatomical theory, we suppose anastomoses between the
cerebral centres of the visual and auditory sensations. Besides
these we have the physiological theory, or that of
nervous irradiation, and the psychological, or that of association.
I do not inquire if all cases may be reduced to a single
explanation; certainly most seem reducible to association.
We are not, however, dealing with any and every form of
association—it must be a psychological one, as Flournoy
was the first to remark. “By emotional association, I mean
that which establishes itself between two impressions, not on
account of a qualitative resemblance (for the two may be
as disparate as sound and colour), nor in virtue of their
regular and frequent concurrence in the consciousness, but
in consequence of the analogy between their emotional
characteristics. Each sensation or perception possesses, in
fact, along with its objective quality or its intellectual content,
a sort of subjective coefficient, springing from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>roots which it sends down into our being, and from the
peculiar way in which it impresses, pleases or displeases,
excites or subdues us, in a word, makes our whole nature
vibrate. We can conceive how two absolutely heterogeneous
sensations, incommensurable as far as their objective content
is concerned, such as a colour and the sound <i>i</i>, may be comparable
with one another and resemble each other more
or less, by virtue of vibrations produced by them in the
organism; and by the same process of thought it is conceivable
that this emotional factor might become a link
between the two, an associative bond by means of which
one awakens the other.”<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c010'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Let us add that we meet, though much more rarely, with
cases of coloured smell and taste, and even, it appears, of
coloured pain.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c010'><sup>[120]</sup></a> This abnormal association between determinate
colours and determinate tastes, odours, pains, may
be explained in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c017'>Shall we attribute to the same cause a fact, ascertained
(exceptionally, however) in the case of certain hysterical subjects
in the hypnotic state, which may be described as
follows? The excitation of certain circumscribed regions
of the body immediately causes to arise in the mind either
ideas or feelings which are imperiously imposed on the
consciousness and last as long as the excitement which
provoked them. Pitres, who has made an extended study
of these “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>zones idéogènes</i></span>,”<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c010'><sup>[121]</sup></a> has discovered about twenty
scattered over various parts of the body in the same subject.
The effect of excitation (by friction or compression) is
always the same in the same individual, but varies from
one individual to another, which excludes the hypothesis
of a previously existing mechanism. Among the feelings
aroused by this procedure I note sadness, cheerfulness,
anger, fear, eroticism, piety, ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c017'>Most writers have limited themselves to the statement of
the fact, without attempting to explain it. Pitres alone
proposes the hypothesis of auto-suggestion, which is not
far from an association of ideas. Must we admit an original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>fortuitous coincidence between a local bodily modification
and a certain emotional state (or idea), whence an association
through contiguity fixed and strengthened by repetition,
so as to become indissoluble? Or can it be that
friction and compression produce in certain subjects
peculiar organic reactions, capable of exciting a special
emotional state? We can only hazard conjectures.</p>

<p class='c017'>In conclusion: the influence of emotional dispositions on
the memory is great, and continually active; it contributes
to the revival and association of ideas. Now, the emotional
states are not entities, but modes of consciousness, the
psychical equivalents of certain organic reactions—visual,
vaso-motor, or muscular; so that the emotional influence
reduces itself to all this. And is all this to be reduced to
movements? A marked tendency towards this opinion is
visible in several of our contemporaries. Fouillée, as we
saw a little while ago, refers all association to that of
impulses; Horwicz does the same under another form (<i>loc. cit.</i>).
He places in the feelings the basis of all conservative
memory, and the basis of all feelings in motion. “We
recall our emotional state in proportion as we can reproduce
the movements implied in it.” By a different road—that of
experiment—Münsterberg has attempted to show that so-called
successive association is reducible to a rapid simultaneity,
and that, if we suppress all movements during the
reception of impressions, memory is much diminished and
reproduction difficult.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c010'><sup>[122]</sup></a> It is true that his experiments were
limited to articulatory movements.</p>

<p class='c017'>I merely indicate in passing this general hypothesis.
Whether admitted or not, the relation between the feelings
and the association of ideas, though often misunderstood,
has been indubitably proved by a mass of facts which, in
spite of their heterogeneous character, all point to the same
conclusion.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The special study of the various manifestations of the
emotional life enables us to penetrate much further into
psychology than do the preceding generalities. This study
is not a merely supplementary or elucidatory one to be
abbreviated, treated cursorily, or even omitted altogether,
as is done by some representatives of the intellectualist
theory. As long as we have not considered, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>seriatim</i></span>
and in detail, every feeling, whether simple or compound,
we have no idea of their rich multiplicity of aspects, of
which general formulas are only meagre abridgments.</p>

<p class='c017'>Some say or imply, contemptuously, that this is a purely
descriptive study. But so long as we have found no other
method of treating the question, it will always be better
than silence. Hitherto, experimentation applied to the
feelings has been kept within very narrow limits, and has
done scarcely anything beyond corroborating the data
furnished by observation. We must therefore modify our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>point of view and seek elsewhere; anthropology, the history
of customs, of arts, religions and sciences, will often be
more useful to us than the contributions of physiology.
The experiments of the laboratory inspire some with a
faith not to be shaken; but the evolution of the feelings in
time and space, through centuries and races, is a laboratory,
operating, for thousands of years, on millions of
men; and its documentary value is a high one. It would
be a great loss to psychology if these documents were
neglected. Having been long confined to introspective
observation, it has deliberately cut itself off from the
biological sciences, considering them alien or useless to
its work. It would not be desirable to fall into a similar
error with regard to the concrete development of human
life, and, after mutilating the study from below, to do
so from above. If the intellectual life has its roots in
biology, it is only in social facts that it can find its
full development. A science never gains by excessive
restriction of its scope; it is better to err in the opposite
direction.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c010'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Since, therefore, we have to pass in review all the forms
of feeling, lower and higher, primary and derived, to
note the successive moments of their development, and to
follow them in their transformations, one question dominates
our whole subject: what causes determine the evolution of
the feelings?</p>

<p class='c017'>In order to give to this question a clear and concrete
form, let us take primitive man, as reconstructed by the
anthropologists, not without much hypothesis and conjecture.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Whether he were the ferocious wild beast
described by some, or a puny, feeble, naked being,
chipping his first weapons among the rolled flints of a
river-bed, keeping up with difficulty his famished life from
day to day, and finding a precarious shelter from incessant
dangers in the hollows of the rocks, it is in any case certain
that he made originally but a poor figure on the surface
of the globe. How has he progressed from primitive
cannibalism to his present moral and social culture? from
the bestial sexual act to chivalrous love? from coarse
fetichism to religious metaphysics or mysticism? from the
rude drawings of the Neolithic age to the refinements of the
æsthetic sentiment? from a narrow and limited curiosity to
a disinterested enthusiasm for science? How has the
passage been accomplished from one extreme to the other?
It is clear that a new form of feeling cannot arise by
spontaneous generation; it can only be the work of a
transformation, of a physiological development. How
has this happened? What causes have brought about this
metamorphosis?</p>

<p class='c017'>The principal, essential, fundamental cause is intellectual
development.</p>

<p class='c017'>Another cause, adduced by many writers, but more
doubtful and more limited in its action, is transmission
by heredity.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. In spite of its importance, the first cause need not
detain us long, since it can only be presented, for the
moment, under the form of vague generalities. Its action
consists in the ascending progression which rises from the
inferior forms of knowledge (sensations and perceptions) to
concrete representations, then to abstract representations
(generic images), then to the medium and superior forms
of abstraction, and involves in its movement concomitant
modifications of affective life produced by reaction.
Primitive man, like the child and the animal, is at first
only a bundle of wants, tendencies, instincts which,
when not simply unconscious, are connected with external
or internal tendencies. The instinct of self-preservation,
a synthetic formula expressing a group of subordinate and
convergent instincts, adjusts itself differently according to
circumstances—sometimes defensive, sometimes offensive.
It is only determined by the successive ends which it has to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>attain, just as the muscular force of my arm may be equally
well employed in raising a weight, in firing a gun, in striking
a blow, or in caressing. The intellectual element, whatever
it may be, is always the determining principle; never, alone
and by itself, the spring of action. The process always
follows the same course, and remains identical from start
to finish; it passes from the simple into the complex, as we
shall see in discussing each separate emotion. The child
who feels acutely the possession of a toy, or the deprivation
of it, is not affected by the beauty of a landscape, by reason
of his limited intellectual power. We know that (in spite of
common opinion) a savage, even a barbarian, is not moved
by the splendours of civilised life, but only by its petty and
puerile sides. Its greater aspects inspire him neither with
desire, admiration, nor jealousy, because he does not understand
them. Bougainville, in the last century, had already
remarked this fact, which has frequently been confirmed
since. Speaking of the profound indifference of the Pacific
Islanders to the skilled construction of his ships and
the instruments belonging to them, he says, “They treat
the masterpieces of human industry as laws and phenomena
of nature.”</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Must we admit heredity as a special and independent
cause of emotional evolution? This problem has
been hotly debated. Darwin, Spencer, and many others
following them, admit that certain acquired variations or
modifications in the range of the feelings may be hereditarily
transmitted, then fixed and organised in a race. They
give as examples, fear, the benevolent feelings, the love of
nature, the musical sense, etc.; the sudden return of so-called
civilised individuals to savage or nomad life, for
want of a hereditary tendency fixed by the habit of several
generations; while the co-existence of predatory tendencies
with the highest culture is for them a case of atavism or
reversion.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c010'><sup>[124]</sup></a> On the other hand, the dominant opinion for
the last twenty years (I think it shows symptoms of
declining) is radically opposed to the inheritance of
acquired modifications. Weismann and Wallace, who, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>than others, have touched on the psychological parts of this
subject, are decidedly for the negative. The question is
therefore an open one, and I accept it as such, in order to
escape the accusation of a bias in favour of heredity.
But even while admitting that there is no fact strictly
conclusive in favour of the transmission of psychic peculiarities,
it nevertheless remains true that some occurrences
of this sort are probable enough, especially in the pathological
order. These belong to the category of appetites,
tendencies, and passions, much more than to the group of
intellectual states. This might have been foreseen, physiological
heredity being more stable than psychological,
and physiological conditions affecting the emotional life
much more immediately than the intellectual.</p>

<p class='c017'>If then, by a reserve which is perhaps superfluous, we
eliminate heredity as a factor in the evolution of the feelings,
the functions of conservation and consolidation ordinarily
attributed to it ought to be assigned to other causes—the
influences of environment, imitation, tradition, education,
with its multitudinous influences. It is clear that a new
mode of emotion, arising in an isolated human consciousness,
cannot last, increase, or become contagious, in totally
different and uncongenial surroundings. Religious mysticism
was irreconcilable with the bloodthirsty cult of the
Aztecs; and what could a native St. Vincent de Paul have
done among a tribe of cannibals, or a Mozart among the
Fuegians?</p>

<p class='c017'>But these influences of environment bring us back, indirectly,
to our original cause; for manners, customs,
traditions, institutions, all these are <em>ideas</em> which, with their
accompanying feelings, have fixed and incarnated themselves
in certain acts serving as starting-points for a new
stage in evolution.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nevertheless, the preceding statements cannot be admitted
without qualification. We have stated it as a law that the
intellectual development involves the evolution of the
feelings; but this rule is not absolute, and should be taken
with important reservations. In the first place, these two
forms of evolution rarely advance <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pari passu</i></span>. Not to
mention the cases in which ideas remain completely ineffectual
and abortive, and produce no movement, their
action, in general, is only felt in the long run, and emotional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>evolution is retarded. In the second place, there
are certain cases where the evolution of feelings is <em>direct</em>,
and precedes that of ideas.</p>

<p class='c017'>The philosophical historian, Buckle, in his study of the
factors of civilisation, points out two as essential—intellectual
progress and moral progress; after which he puts to
himself what he calls a very grave question: which of
these two is the more important, and dominant over the
other? He is decisive in choosing the first. Buckle’s
question is in great part ours; for, though not comprehending
all the manifestations of the emotional life, the
moral sentiments form at least a very important fraction of
it. His answer seems to me a legitimate one; but he was
too much imbued with the notion that it is sufficient for an
idea to be true and clearly conceived to make it an incentive
to action; and he seems never to suspect that an idea
can only supplant a feeling on condition of becoming a
feeling itself.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c010'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The intellect is capable of instantaneously finding out a
new truth, or recognising an idea as just and conformable
to the nature of things; but all this remains in a theoretic
condition—<i>i.e.</i>, without emotional colouring or tendency to
realise itself. That which is discovered so rapidly by means
of logic, takes years, or even centuries, to become a motive
for action. “If the Greeks were unable to extend their
feelings of humanity so as to include the barbarians, the
cause lay, not in intellectual insufficiency, but in the
arrestive power of their national feeling. Christianity overthrew
these barriers, not by means of intellectual reflection,
but by the effect of an acute and deeply-seated feeling.
Afterwards, within the limits of Christianity, intolerance
raised new barriers, and fettered the natural development
of religion.”<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c010'><sup>[126]</sup></a> We might find in history numerous examples
of this inertia of the feelings, as in the case of slavery, etc.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>We imagine the emotions as in a state of perpetual
motion and instability, whilst a habitual manner of feeling,
in fact, possesses a formidable arrestive power, only
gradually lost under the influence of time. It is a
common saying that an argument has never changed a
conviction; but this is only the case if we regard the
present; it can act by incubation and at a great distance of
time.</p>

<p class='c017'>Another reason for disagreement between the two modes
of development, the intellectual and the emotional, may be
expressed under a form which, though rather pedantic, is
clear and precise. Intellectual evolution is subject to the
principle of contradiction, emotional evolution is not; it is,
indeed, subject to a logical principle to be determined later,
but the principle is another. Let us suppose a purely
intellectual being: affirmations and negations regarding
the same object cannot co-exist in his brain; one eliminates
the other. If we suppose a purely emotional being
it will be found that two opposite tendencies can
be simultaneously active in him, each working towards
its own end, provided that they do not bring about the
destruction of the individual. In every individual who
contradicts himself there is, at the moment when he
contradicts himself, an emotional element at work. We
shall see later on that this is the key to all contradictory
characters, which are quite natural from the emotional
point of view, though they are the stumbling-blocks of the
intellect.</p>

<p class='c017'>Finally, in certain cases the emotional development is
completely detached from the other, and even in advance
of it; this is direct evolution. Feeling, as has been said,
is the pioneer of knowledge—<i>i.e.</i>, it sometimes involves a
confused knowledge; it is the anticipation of an ideal.
In this case it is not an idea which excites a feeling, but
the development of a feeling which ends by taking concrete
form in an idea; its source is in the temperament and the
character. The theory of evolution has familiarised us
with the notion of spontaneous variations in animals and
plants. This phenomenon is also found in psychology—in
the intellectual order, in the emotional order, in the
order of action. We are too much inclined to believe that
inventors, revealers, initiators, exist only in the region of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>knowledge or activity; but in the region of feeling, too,
there are spontaneous variations, both serviceable and
injurious. If there are original ways of thinking, there are
also original ways of feeling, which impose themselves on
others, create a contagion. We shall find examples of
this in abundance, for these “variations” have played
a great part, especially in the evolution of the moral
sentiment.</p>

<p class='c017'>These remarks are of too general a character, but will be
supplemented later on, when we come to study each form
of emotion in its turn. Such is the object of our second
part. It will consist of a series of monographs of varying
length. Except for a general survey of the law which seems
to govern the dissolution of the feelings, their pathology
will not be treated in a special section, but will be distributed
throughout the work, terminating the study of
each normal form, but only in such measure as will serve
to render their nature more comprehensible, in which case
it partakes of the character of psychology.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Before setting out on our journey we must map out our
route. At the beginning of this work I presented the
reader with a general survey of the emotional life; it will
be necessary to return to this subject in a briefer, more
precise, and more limited manner. Since complex emotions
are derived from simple emotions, and the latter from needs
and instincts, whether satisfied or thwarted, from tendencies
which are the direct and immediate expression of our
physical and mental constitution; since the irreducible
element is a motor phenomenon, actual or virtual, realised
or in a nascent condition, it is indispensable to draw up a
list of those primitive tendencies or instincts which are
the roots of emotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>On this point we have very little clear knowledge. Some
writers do not notice it at all; others content themselves
with a haphazard enumeration. W. James, who has
seriously occupied himself with the question, lays down
the principle that man has as many instincts as the animals,
and even more, which seems to me indisputable. But his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>list, which he closes by saying that some will find it
too long and others too short, contains very heterogeneous
elements: instincts which are certainly primitive,
derived instincts (as the love of possession), instincts
whose existence as such is disputed (as imitation), pathological
instincts (as the phobias or pathological fears,
kleptomania, etc.), which last can only be considered
anomalous, and, therefore, very different from simple and
indecomposable instincts.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c010'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Although it is rash to engage in a campaign in which
some have fled and others failed, we must nevertheless
attempt to draw up a list of primitive instincts (or tendencies),
since these are the sources of all pleasures, pains, emotions,
and passions. I can see but one method of attaining this
end—a method long employed in animal psychology: that
of admitting to the list of human instincts only those which
present the following characteristics:—(1) They are innate.
This does not imply that they appear at the very hour of
birth, but that they are anterior to experience, not acquired;
that they appear ready made, as soon as the fitting
conditions exist. Those which are called <em>deferred</em> instincts,
which make their appearance late, such as the sexual
instinct in man and many animals, are none the less innate.
(2) They are specific. They exist in the entire race, except
for some individuals, who by reason of their exemption are,
on the point in question, abnormal; so various instincts
are wanting in the idiot. (3) They are fixed, in a relative
sense; for no one now maintains the theory of the absolute
invariability of instinct; and in man its plasticity is
extreme, because a superior power, that of intelligence,
moulds and adapts it to its designs.</p>

<p class='c017'>These characteristics being determined, it remains to
apply them in chronological order, and, starting with the
birth of the individual, to draw up the catalogue of actual,
strictly innate instincts. We shall then follow the course of
life, noting the appearance of every new and indecomposable
instinct, and thus continue till we have exhausted the
list.</p>

<p class='c017'>I propose to divide the instincts into three groups: the
earliest in date being essentially physiological in its nature,
the second psycho-physiological, the third essentially psychological.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>We shall not need to study them all, because
some are outside the domain of general psychology, and
others unconnected with the psychology of the emotions.
The enumeration will be made, for the moment, in a very
bald form, like a table of contents.</p>

<p class='c017'>Group I. These belong to the life which biologists call
organic or vegetative, as opposed to the life of relation.
All these converge towards a single end, the fundamental
act of life—nutrition. To simplify the matter as much as
possible, let us divide this act into three stages: reception,
transformation, and restitution.</p>

<p class='c017'>(1) The first only has any psychological interest,
showing itself in consciousness by two very energetic needs—hunger
and thirst. It is almost superfluous to say that
these instincts pass beyond the bounds of psychology into
the domain of sociology, where their function is a very
important one, as is seen by the phenomena of dearth,
famine, theft, crimes, cannibalism, deadly combats for the
possession of a little water, etc. Their pathology is thus
more instructive than one would think, because it states
and resolves, as we shall see, in a simple form, the problem
of whether the tendency is anterior to pleasure and pain.</p>

<p class='c017'>(2) The stage of transformation is purely physiological.
It, too, shows itself in needs, of which the most pressing
is that of breathing, an indispensable condition of the
combustion of matter and the consequent <a id='corr196.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='insterstitial'>interstitial</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_196.26'><ins class='correction' title='insterstitial'>interstitial</ins></a></span>
exchanges. If air had to be acquired and conquered, like
food, this instinct would show itself in consciousness, as do
hunger and thirst; but this rarely happens (dyspnœa,
asphyxia). Its pathology is not instructive, and only
comprises individual peculiarities, such as always breathing
either hot or cold air, sleeping with open windows, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>(3) The stage of restitution outwards (secretions, excretions,
etc.), though showing itself by instinctive movements,
is only very indirectly connected with our subject;
and though, in fact, <em>nothing</em> which takes place in the
organism is quite unconnected with psychology, we may
pass this over in silence.</p>

<p class='c017'>Group II. These instincts belong to the so called
relative life, and correspond to two stages—those of reception
and restitution. The first stage is represented by all
the forms of external perception, and comprises the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>tendencies connected with the exercise of each of our
senses, the tendency of each sensory organ to fulfil its
function: the eye tends to see, the hand to grasp and feel.
These tendencies, if satisfied, are agreeable; if obstructed,
unpleasant. Hence result pleasure and pain, but not
emotions properly so called. The second stage is represented
by all the forms of muscular movement, tendencies
to action, to the production of noises, as in certain animals,
to cries, vocalisation, gestures, and bodily attitudes. We
have seen that all these things, in popular opinion, serve to
express emotions, while, in our view, they are integral parts
of them.</p>

<p class='c017'>Group III. This group of tendencies no longer has for its
end reception or restitution, but the conservation and development
of the individual as a conscious being. They express
not his physical, but his psychical constitution, his mental
organisation under its different aspects; they embody his
needs as a spiritual being; as breathing, hunger, thirst, etc.
embody his needs as a living being. They all therefore
have a psychological character, and are the source of that
complexus of pleasant, painful, or mixed movements and
states which we call emotions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us recall the chronological order of their appearance
already indicated elsewhere: (1) The instinct of conservation
under its defensive form expressed by fear, with its
varieties and morbid forms (<em>phobias</em>). (2) The instinct of
conservation under its aggressive form—<i>i.e.</i>, anger and its
derivatives, and (in a morbid form) the destructive impulses.
(3) The sympathetic tendencies and the tender (non-sexual)
emotions. It may, however, be questioned whether sympathy
can be called a tendency in the strict sense; it seems
to me to be rather a general property of sentient beings, a
point which will be examined later. The same thing may
be said of the imitative instinct or tendency to imitation,
which does not appear to be indecomposable.</p>

<p class='c017'>These three primitive tendencies and emotions, with their
derivatives, form the first storey of the building. Fear and
anger especially have an extremely general character; we
can descend very low in the animal scale before we find
them absent. The tender emotions, based on sympathy
(the source of social and moral emotions), cover a much
narrower area; they are, however, to be found among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>lower animals under the form of temporary or permanent
associations.</p>

<p class='c017'>The other tendencies are slower in appearing, and their
circle is more restricted: (4) The play-instinct, if we use
this word to designate the tendency to expend superfluous
activity. This is a stock which puts forth several branches:
(<i>a</i>) the need of physical exercise; (<i>b</i>) the taste for a life of
adventure; (<i>c</i>) the passion for gambling, which so soon
becomes morbid; (<i>d</i>) æsthetic activity. (5) The tendency
towards knowledge (curiosity) only appears with a certain
degree of intelligence and attention; at first connected with
the exercise of the senses (looking at an object, touching it,
etc.), it is strictly practical, though at a later stage producing
all the varieties of the intellectual sentiment. (6) At a later
epoch, and perhaps in man alone, are manifested the
egotistic tendencies (self-feeling, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Selbstgefühl</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>amor proprius</i></span>),
which express the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego</i></span>, the personality as conscious of itself,
and show themselves in the emotion of pride, or its opposite,
and their varieties. (7) There remains the latest in date
(at least in man), the sex-instinct, of which the exceedingly
general character is well known.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such are the tendencies which, in my opinion, are the
roots of all simple or compound emotions, present, past, or
future. This assertion will be justified or invalidated by the
following studies.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h3 id='ch2.1' class='c005'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br /> THE INSTINCT OF CONSERVATION IN ITS <br />PHYSIOLOGICAL FORM.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Hypothesis regarding the relation between the nutritive organs
and the brain—Perversion of the instincts relating to
nutrition—Pathology of hunger and thirst—Proofs
furnished of the priority of these tendencies in relation
to pleasure and pain—Facts in support of this—Negative
tendency; disgust—Its biological value as a protective
instinct.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>The above title may seem quite unconnected with psychology,
or at least of a nature to throw little light on our
subject. This is not the case. This group of tendencies—for
we have seen that the conservative instinct is a sum,
a total—represents the principal factors in what is called
cœnæsthesia, the very soil on which emotional life grows
and bears fruit. Moreover, the nutritive instincts have
their pathology, which enables us to watch, not the genesis
(which would be impossible) of new tendencies, but a
radical transformation, a complete change of orientation,
whose effects are easily observable and instructive. In a
normal state the instincts are presented to us as ready made
and in action; we cannot, either in ourselves or in others,
go back to that distant and obscure period when the unconscious
impulse, the blind tendency, showed itself for the
first time, without antecedent experience of the pleasant or
unpleasant consequences. So that our affirmation that
tendency is antecedent to pleasure and pain may be stigmatised
as merely theoretical so long as we are unable to
cite indubitable facts in demonstration of it. These facts
we are about to furnish.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>
  <h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c019'>The nutritive acts take place in the inmost recesses of the
tissues and organs. By what channels are they connected
with the cortex, either when undergoing its influence
or transmitting the echoes of their slackening, accelerative,
and other modifications? On this point physiologists
know little. According to some (Schiff, Brown-Séquard),
there are relations between the digestive tube and
the optic layer, the striated body, the cerebral peduncles;
the psychic actions which modify respiration being transmitted
through the third ventricle and the anterior corpora
quadrigemina. The experiments of Pitres and François-Franck
on the sensori-motor zone of the cortex show that
excitement, at any given point, results in: augmentation,
retardation, or even arrest of breathing; acceleration of
the cardiac rhythm, and, if powerful, inhibition or even
syncope; vaso-motor effects, a contraction or relaxation of
the bladder; an influence on uterine contractions; on the
secretion of the saliva and the pancreatic juice, and on
trophic action in general. According to Goltz, the destruction
of the anterior lobes produces atrophy, that of the
posterior the contrary effect. These discrepancies and
uncertainties are to us of small importance; but it remains
certain that the nutritive functions especially depend on the
pneumogastric and the great sympathetic nerves, that they
are in some manner represented in the cerebral cortex and
form the principal contents of cœnæsthesia. Though in the
adult they play only a latent and intermittent part by reason
of the preponderance of external sensations, images, and
ideas, it is probable that in animals, particularly in voracious
ones, the functions are inverted, and that cœnæsthesia, as a
synthesis of the organic functions, passes to the front rank.
This has even been asserted to be the case in children and
savages, the argument being based on the fact that they
have, in proportion, larger stomachs and longer intestines,
and on various other characteristics.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c010'><sup>[128]</sup></a> However this may
be, when deep-seated disturbances take place in the
organism, cœnæsthesia is modified; which involves modification
of the tendencies, and, consequently, of the position
of pleasure and pain.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The facts I am about to enumerate relate to nutritive
needs only; but we shall find their equivalents or analogies
in the other manifestations of emotional life. We can,
therefore, already generalise so far as to say that when
abnormal or morbid tendencies, however absurd or violent,
show themselves, their satisfaction involves pleasure, their
non-satisfaction, pain. Where the normal man, with normal
tendencies, places pleasure, the abnormal man, with abnormal
tendencies, places pain. Conversely, that which
the man with normal tendencies feels to be agreeable,
the man with abnormal tendencies feels to be unpleasant.
Pleasure and pain follow the changes of tendency, as the
shadow follows the movements of the body.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us look at the facts. We have at this moment to do
only with the perversion of instincts relative to nutrition.</p>

<p class='c017'>Pregnancy produces during the first few months digestive,
circulatory, secretory disturbances, incomplete nutrition, and
at the same time those grotesque aberrations of appetite,
those depraved tastes, which every one knows, and of which
the catalogue would be endless. Not to digress from the
subject of this chapter, I say nothing of those morbid
tendencies of another kind which show themselves at the
same time in some women—homicidal or suicidal tendencies,
aversion to husband, kleptomania, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>In anæmic, chlorotic, hysteric, and other subjects, if
badly nourished, we sometimes find an acute pleasure
in earth, straw, tobacco, chalk, sand, charcoal, etc., and an
aversion to the most savoury foods.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c010'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>There are many instances of hypochondriacs searching
for and devouring with enjoyment worms, toads, spiders,
caterpillars, etc.; and the beginning of insanity is often
marked by an eccentric and disordered dietary.</p>

<p class='c017'>Again, at a still lower stage, we have coprophagy and
scatophagy (the swallowing of excrements, urine, the contents
of spittoons, etc.), which are rarely, if ever, found in any but
idiots and those suffering from dementia, <i>i.e.</i>, in beings whose
simplest instincts have been abolished or perverted. The
voracity of certain idiots has been attributed to paralysis of
the gastric branch of the vagus nerve.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c010'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The same would apply to the sense of smell, so intimately
associated with that of taste that it has justly been called
“tasting at a distance.” (We must not, moreover, forget
its close connection with the sex-instinct.) Certain persons,
who cannot endure the most delicate aromas, enjoy the
odour of valerian, of asafœtida, and of still more repulsive
substances.</p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up, we may say that, in a given race, at a given
moment of its development, there is a certain average of
alimentary tastes, whose satisfaction is pleasurable; but on
the appearance of deep-seated disturbances in the organism
everything is changed, tendencies, desires, and aversions;
the pleasurable and painful states, <em>which are merely effects</em>,
vary with and in the same manner as their cause.</p>

<p class='c017'>The physiological acts, which have for their aim the maintenance
of nutrition, scarcely enter into the consciousness,
except under the guise of hunger and thirst, whose psychology
cannot be studied here, because it forms part of another
department—that of the sensations. All the phenomena
previously enumerated are reducible to anomalies or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>deviations of hunger. The pathology of thirst is simpler,
for it may be summed up as dipsomania, a condition whose
modalities and clinical varieties have no interest as regards
the psychology of instinct; but so far as this need is concerned,
the transformation of the normal and natural
tendency into a morbid one does not differ in its
mechanism and results from what we have already stated
in the case of hunger.</p>

<p class='c017'>There exist, in general and special treatises, many descriptions
of dipsomania to which we may refer the reader.
Leaving aside all hallucinations, motor disturbances, intellectual
and moral decadence, we shall only consider the
genesis, the development, and the consolidation of this
morbid tendency.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is not every one who can be a dipsomaniac.” To
drink too much, whether voluntarily or by accident, is a
thing which may happen to any one; but such an occurrence
does not necessarily bear the fatal and inexorable
character of an insatiable instinct. The period of incubation—<i>i.e.</i>,
of gradual action tending towards complete
metamorphosis—presents clearly-marked psychological characteristics,
showing a disturbed state of cœnæsthesia and
belonging to the region of the emotions: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malaise</i></span>, sadness,
lack of energy and courage, apathy, moral insensibility,
vague presentiments of danger. After this the
eruption takes place in the form of an intense, devouring
thirst. Many try to react on this and cheat themselves by
the aid of water or mucilaginous substances, which shows,
as several writers on the subject have remarked, that
alcoholism properly so called is only a paroxysm: under the
pressure of a progressively intensified craving the decisive
step is taken. We shall find a great variety in the numerous
observations published on this subject, a struggle at the
beginning only, a struggle preceding every attack, indignation
of the patient against himself, under the influence of
which he calls himself names, and forces himself to swallow
strange and repugnant beverages; all these phenomena
are found in various cases. To sum up, the history of
this psychological metamorphosis is briefly this: incubation,
formation of a fixed idea, obsession, final fall.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is scarcely necessary to point out once more that the
primary fact is the transformation of a natural tendency,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>in consequence of changes in the organism, and that satisfaction
and appeasement only come <em>afterwards</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Nutrition—<i>i.e.</i>, the essential act of physiological life—is
safeguarded by two distinct kinds of tendencies. (I
am still speaking of those only which come within the
bounds of consciousness, and therefore have a psychological
character.) On the one hand, we have the positive tendencies,
consisting in an attraction towards and attack on the
external world (in this case, food and drink)—viz., hunger
and thirst. On the other hand, the negative tendencies
consisting in aversion, refusal, flight, and summed up in the
state known as disgust.</p>

<p class='c017'>Disgust is due to excitement of the pneumogastric nerve,
producing vomiting, nausea, or mere <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malaise</i></span>. This repulsive
instinct is connected (1) directly and immediately
with taste and smell, two senses which can scarcely be
isolated, and whose function is to watch over all substances
entering the organism; (2) indirectly and through association
of ideas with visual and tactile sensations (sticky,
slimy bodies, etc.), by analogy and metaphorically with
certain objects which have nothing in common with the
nutritive functions—the ugly, the immoral, etc. In virtue
of that law of transference or association of analogous
sensations, of which we have spoken, the tendency departs
more and more from its primary form; but in all cases
there is a common groundwork of repulsion, refusal, desire
to escape, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>Disgust under its primary form (the only one now
occupying us) has not been much studied. Writers have
contented themselves with classing it among organic sensations,
while neglecting its emotional side, <i>i.e.</i>, its function in
the conservation of the individual. The only work I know
on this subject is the excellent monograph of Ch. Richet,<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c010'><sup>[131]</sup></a>
of which I here give a summary.</p>

<p class='c017'>Disgust is connected with conservation; it is “an instinctive
feeling of protection.” In order to justify this statement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the author passes in review the various objects in
nature, noting those which inspire us with disgust, and
inquiring into the cause of this. The inorganic kingdom,
in general, leaves us indifferent; yet sulphuretted hydrogen,
ammonia, and various other gases cause a marked repulsion.
This is the effect of an association of ideas; the smell
recalls that of decomposition, of a corpse. As regards the
vegetable kingdom, the herbivora, by reason of their diet,
are the best subjects for observation; their instinct scarcely
ever deceives them in the choice of food. We are reminded
that, on their arrival in the New World, the Spaniards,
hesitating before an unknown flora, whose properties were
unknown to them, trusted the judgment of their horses.
In man, Richet attributes the repellent influence exerted by
bitter aromas to the fact that they frequently co-exist with
toxic properties; he takes as types the vegetable alkaloids
(quinine, nicotine, etc.), whose power as poisons is in some
degree proportioned to their bitterness. So that we have
always, at bottom, “the love of life and the horror of
death.” In the animal kingdom disgust is aroused by
putrescent matter, which indicates or suggests cadaveric
decomposition and toxic substances; by parasites, by
animals really venomous, or so reputed; for instinct,
which sees everything in mass, confounds in the same
repugnance the toad and the frog, the venomous serpent
and the harmless snake.</p>

<p class='c017'>In its general bearing, the thesis of the finality of disgust
is incontestable. There are, no doubt, many exceptions,
many facts difficult to explain (some have been pointed out
by Richet); but if we take into account the complexity of
the question, all objections fall to the ground.</p>

<p class='c017'>That tastes are not to be argued about is a platitude
which has been worn threadbare for centuries past. Taken
literally, it would reduce disgust to a purely intellectual
manifestation, with no biological bearing; it would deprive
it of all specific character, and utterly eliminate it as an
instinct. This, however, is a merely superficial position.
Contradictions in taste may be compared with contradictions
in morality. Variations in manners and customs,
according to race, epoch, country, and even caste, do not
exclude the existence of a law which has this characteristic
common to all cases—that it is derived from the conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of existence of each group, and is by that right imposed on
it. In the same way, disgust exists everywhere, under one
form or another, as a protective instinct. The question is
complicated, in man, by his intellectual development, and
the consequent modification, transformation, or even suppression
of this instinct. Between reasoned knowledge and
instinctive tendency a battle has been fought, in which the
victory inclined sometimes to one side, sometimes to the
other. We know the repugnance of animals towards a
change of food. The same thing is seen in children, and
in the inferior races, when not pressed by necessity. Plasticity
grows with civilisation.</p>

<p class='c017'>We may add to this the necessity for new adaptations;
thus, in a besieged town, people devour unclean food; the
instinct of physiological conservation is a “divided house,”
where the positive form struggles against the negative with
results, varying in different individuals. To this antagonism
between primitive instinct and more complex rational
motives let us add the influence of imitation and of fashion,
and there will remain few or no unexplained exceptions.</p>

<p class='c017'>As for the <em>origin</em> of this instinct, if we accept the hypothesis
of acquired modifications, we may say that the
animals and men best fitted for abstaining from hurtful
substances, have <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> better chances of survival, and
that they have been able to transmit to their descendants
certain qualities which became fixed and organised as an

<p class='c016'>The instinct of individual conservation, under its defensive
form, is the origin of the emotion called fear, and its
varieties. We have already said, more than once, that it
is the first in chronological order of appearance, showing
itself, according to Preyer, at twenty-three days; according
to Perez, at two months; while Darwin puts it as late as the
fourth month. It is the first manifestation in the consciousness
of emotion properly so called, as a psycho-physiological
complexus. Following the method which will be
invariably applied to every emotion, simple or composite,
we shall examine in turn its psychology and its pathology.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>It has been defined as “the particular emotive reaction
which takes place through a sufficiently vivid and persistent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>representation of possible pain or evil.”<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c010'><sup>[132]</sup></a> This formula,
though good in the majority of cases, does not seem applicable
to the first stage of fear, as we shall see presently.</p>

<p class='c017'>The physiology of fear has been worked out by Darwin,
Mantegazza, Mosso, and Lange. I prefer the last writer’s
description, as being more systematic; it is not a collection
of isolated facts, but a logically arranged synopsis. We
know already the importance attached by him to the
physiological conditions of each emotion. The characteristic
marks of fear are:—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. As regards the innervation of the voluntary muscles: a
greater weakening than in the case of sorrow, a convulsive
tremor; in extreme cases, suppression of all movement,
one is fixed to the spot; voice hoarse and broken, or complete
dumbness; in short, a more or less accentuated
paralysis of the whole voluntary motor apparatus.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. As regards the muscles of organic life: arrest of the
lacteal secretion, of menstruation, of the salivary secretion;
the mouth dry, the tongue adhering to the palate; cold
sweats, “goose-flesh,” bristling of the hair, arrest of respiration,
oppression, constriction of the throat. Fear also, as is
well known, influences the intestinal secretions.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. As regards the vaso-motor apparatus: a spasmodic
constriction of the vessels, shiverings, violent spasm of the
heart; and if the impression is of excessive violence,
paralysis, which may end in death; pallor, and peripheral
anæmia.</p>

<p class='c017'>These manifestations collectively express a lowering of
the vital tone which in no other emotion is so complete and
so clearly marked. It has been maintained with reason
that fear has a teleological character, that it is adapted to an
end—that of withdrawing, escaping, exposing one’s self as
little as possible to attack, and remaining on the defensive
in view of possible approaching evil. However, the case is
not so simple as it appears. The slight or moderate forms
of fear, through the feeling of weakness produced by them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>in the consciousness, are a protection against hurtful actions
by inducing withdrawal or flight. But the grave forms, such
as terror and fright, accompanied by trembling and motor
annihilation, place us face to face with a great difficulty.
When existence is menaced, at the most decisive moment,
when attack, defence, or flight is urgently demanded, we
see men and animals, paralysed with agitation, fall victims,
unable to make any use of what strength they have.
Darwin confines himself to remarking that the problem is
very obscure (ch. xiii.). Mantegazza (<i>op. cit.</i>, ch. vii.)
alleges that trembling is extremely useful, because it tends
to produce heat and warm the blood, which, under the
influence of terror, would soon grow cold. Mosso has very
good reasons to oppose to his compatriot’s thesis. He
considers the “cataplexy” which accompanies the extreme
forms of fear as a grave imperfection of the organism.
“One would think that nature, in making the brain
and spinal cord, was unable to devise a substance of
extreme excitability which should at the same time, under
the influence of exceptionally strong stimuli, be capable of
never passing in its reactions beyond the limits needful for
the preservation of the animal.” In short, terror and fright
appear to him in the light of morbid phenomena. From
the naturalistic point of view this extra-teleological position
is perfectly admissible. A finalist conception of the world
admits of no exceptions, and has to explain everything
according to its own principle; but if we content ourselves
with saying that the conditions of existence of a living
being are sometimes given, sometimes absent, we have no
more to do but verify the cases in which they are wanting
and the occurrences logically following therefrom.</p>

<p class='c017'>The psychology of fear includes two stages, to be studied
quite distinctly. There is a primary, instinctive, unreasoning
fear preceding all individual experience, and a secondary,
conscious, reasoned fear posterior to experience. They are
generally confounded with one another, and as the second
is by far the most frequent, it serves as the typical form in
descriptions.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>First Stage.</i>—Numerous observations prove the existence
of an innate fear, not attributable to any individual experience.
In children, Preyer<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c010'><sup>[133]</sup></a> maintains the existence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“a hereditary fear manifesting itself on occasion.” Many
are afraid of dogs and cats, though they have never
been bitten or scratched; thunder makes them cry out—why?
The fear of falling, says the same author, during
first attempts at walking, is as strange as the fear shown
towards animals. At fourteen months, this writer’s son
could not venture to take a step without support, and was
full of terror if the person holding him let go; yet he had
never experienced a fall. He concludes, very justly, that
“it is quite erroneous to think that the child who has not
been taught to fear things does not know fear. The
courage or fearfulness of the mother certainly exercises a great
influence; but there are in children so many cases of
motiveless fear that we must admit some hereditary
influence.” The same fact has been observed in young
animals: Spalding’s experiments on newly-hatched chickens
and their instinctive terror of the hawk are well known.
Preyer repeated this experiment, with like results. Gratiolet,
as I have already said, relates that a little dog, who
had never seen a wolf, on smelling a piece of the skin of
that animal, was seized with indescribable terror. Adult
man, though his fears are in general based on experience,
sometimes manifests (at least this is the case with ignorant
and primitive people) vague, unconscious fears of the
unknown, of darkness, of mysterious powers, witchcraft,
sorcery, magic, etc. Ignorance is a great source of terror;
and Bain has said, not without reason, that knowledge
is the great remedy against fear.</p>

<p class='c017'>How shall we explain the apprehension of an evil which
has never been experienced? Even if we admit that fear
may sometimes, and from the very beginning of life
onward, start from analogies, resemblances, associations of
ideas, there remain many cases which can be reduced to
no simple form. We have seen that Preyer, following
Darwin, Spencer, and other evolutionists, admits the
influence of heredity. It is a well-known fact that birds
on uninhabited islands show no fear when they see
man for the first time; they are taught by hard experience
to distrust him, and the acquired fear is, on this theory,
transmitted to their descendants. According to this
hypothesis, fear would be, always and everywhere, the
result of experience, whether individual or ancestral,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and what we have called the second stage would be the
first, and indeed the only one.</p>

<p class='c017'>This explanation is naturally rejected by those who
refuse to believe in the inheritance of acquired qualities,
though they have nothing satisfactory to propose in its
place. Besides, this is a question of origin, on which
experimental psychology may well recognise its incompetence.
Not to remain on debatable ground, we must
admit—since individual experience cannot be appealed to—that
the bases of fear exist in the organism, form part
of the constitution of animals and men, and help them
to live by a defensive adaptation, which in most cases
proves useful. As for the obscure mechanism of this
instinctive fear, we may suppose that certain sensations
produce a painful shock which excites the organic, motor,
and vaso-motor relations constituting emotion, and that the
conservative instinct, in order to escape <em>actual</em> pain, reacts
blindly, with or without profit. This makes it impossible
to explain certain innate fears by reason.</p>

<p class='c017'>For my own part, I consider the hypothesis of a hereditary
disposition to certain fears as extremely probable.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c010'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><i>Second Stage.</i>—The definition given above may be
unrestrictedly applied to conscious and reasoned fear
posterior to experience. It is based, not on the intellectual,
but on the emotional memory. The attempts of
the earlier associationists to account for fear as a mere
product of association, as in James Mill’s doctrine that it
is the idea of a painful sensation associated with the idea of
its being future, were wholly inadequate through ignoring
the essential factor, the emotional element, the organic
disturbance.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c010'><sup>[135]</sup></a> If I am to be afraid of the extraction of a
tooth, it is necessary that, in the memory of a former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>operation, its painful colouring should be revived, at any
rate in a modified form; if I have only a dry recollection,
with no physiological vibration, fear will not arise. There
is no need to insist on a point already fully treated of in the
First Part.</p>

<p class='c017'>It results from this that we are accessible to fear in
proportion as the representation of future evil is intense,
<i>i.e.</i>, emotional and not intellectual, felt and not understood.
In many persons the absence of fear only amounts to the
absence of imagination. This explains how it is that every
lowering of vitality, whether permanent or temporary, predisposes
to this emotion; the physiological conditions which
engender (or accompany it) are all ready; in a weakened
organism fear is always in a nascent condition.</p>

<p class='c017'>The emotion which now occupies us exists in all degrees,
from such feeble forms as suspicion and apprehension to
the extreme ones of panic and terror. These gradations,
fixed by language, cannot have a distinct psychological
description made of each of them. Nevertheless, Bain has
attempted to enumerate the different kinds of fear, and some
experiments of Féré’s indicate the different physiological
effects following each degree of fear.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c010'><sup>[136]</sup></a> When an owl, a
serpent, or a spectre was caused to appear, by suggestion,
the muscular reaction, shown in graphic tracings, was
different in every case.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>To draw a distinction between the normal and morbid
forms of fear is a task which, at first sight, might appear
tolerably difficult. We have, however, a criterion to guide
us. Every form of fear which, instead of being useful,
becomes hurtful, which, ceasing to be a means of protection,
becomes a means of destruction, is pathological. We have
already (Part I., chap. iv.) indicated the marks which enable
us to discriminate between the healthy and the morbid; I
recall them once more.</p>

<p class='c017'>Morbid emotion presents one or more of the following
characteristics: it is apparently disproportionate to its cause;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>it is chronic; its physical accompaniments are of extraordinary
intensity.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the question of morbid fears, now known by the
name of <em>phobias</em>, there exists a great mass of observations,
notes, and papers, which is increasing day by day, and
contains far more enumerations and descriptions than
attempts at explanation. J. Falret and Westphal (in
his essay on agoraphobia, 1872) seem to be the first who
have entered on this path. To Westphal’s fear of open
spaces and Falret’s fear of contact may be added many
others; and we pass through a first period, where we find a
veritable deluge of <em>phobias</em>, each having its special name;
one person fears needles, another glass, one low places,
another high places, one water, another fire, etc. Every
morbid manifestation of fear is immediately fitted with a
Greek designation, or one so reputed, and we have aïcmophobia,
belenophobia, thalassophobia, potamophobia, etc.,
even siderodromophobia (the fear of railways) and triakaidekaphobia
(fear of the number 13!). The list of these
<em>phobias</em> would fill pages, and it is clear that there is no
reason why it should ever stop; all the objects in creation
might be included in it, if clothed in pseudo-Greek garb.</p>

<p class='c017'>Accordingly, a reaction has taken place. Instead of, as
was at first done, considering each phobia separately, naming
it after its object, and so losing one’s self in endless varieties,
the tendency now is to regard them only as individual cases of
a general morbid disposition, whose essential psychological
characteristics are a fixed idea or obsession, and symptoms
of fear sometimes reaching the dimensions of a paroxysm,
and expressing themselves in convulsions and hysterical
attacks.</p>

<p class='c017'>Several classifications have been proposed, with a view to
introducing some order into this multiplicity. Some proceed
subjectively, classifying according to the sensations, perceptions,
images, ideas, or feelings which form the basis of
the fear. Thus the fear of contact is connected with touch,
agoraphobia with sight, and so on. Others proceed objectively;
Régis proposes five groups: (1) the fear of
inanimate objects; (2) of living beings (fear of crowds,
solitude, inoffensive animals); (3) of spaces (agoraphobia,
claustrophobia); (4) of meteorological phenomena; (5) of
illness (nosophobia, with its very numerous varieties). To be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>accurate, these classifications, though they may be useful to
the clinical lecturer, are of no great advantage to the
psychology of fear; the interesting problem lies elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c017'>Before reaching this, let us remark that, apart from any
particular fears, there exist some observations on a vague but
permanent state of anxiety or terror, which has been called
panphobia, or pantophobia (Beard). This is a state in
which the patient fears everything or nothing, where
anxiety, instead of being riveted on one object, floats as
in a dream, and only becomes fixed for an instant at a time,
passing from one object to another, as circumstances may
determine.</p>

<p class='c017'>If, leaving aside the endless enumeration of the kinds of
fear and their description, we seek—for this is the task
incumbent on psychology—to determine their derivation
from normal fear, and the causes which excite them,
we enter an almost unexplored region and pass from
riches to indigence.</p>

<p class='c017'>As far as concerns their psychological origin, <i>i.e.</i>, the
determination of the normal type from which they are
deviations, I propose reducing them to two groups.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first is directly connected with fear, and includes all
manifestations implying in any degree whatever the fear of
pain, from that of a fall or the prick of a needle to that of
illness or death. The second is directly connected with
disgust, and seems to me to include the forms which have
sometimes been called <em>pseudophobia</em> (Gélineau). Such are
the fear of contact, the horror of blood, and of innocuous
animals, and many strange and causeless aversions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us remark, furthermore, that fear and disgust have a
common basis, being both instruments of protection or
defence. The first is the defensive-conservative instinct of
the relative life, the second the defensive-conservative instinct
of the organic life. As both have a common basis of
aversion, they show themselves in equivalent ways: fear by
withdrawal, departure, flight; disgust by vomiting or nausea.
The reflexes of disgust are the succedanea of flight; the
organism cannot escape by movement in space from the
repugnant body which it has taken into itself, and goes
through a movement of expulsion instead.</p>

<p class='c017'>After having traced back all morbid fears to two sources—which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>may indeed be reduced to one—we have to seek for
their causes. One very general cause, with which most authors
content themselves, is degeneracy. I shall speak of this
elsewhere (see <a href='#CONCLUSION'>Conclusion</a>); but as it is constantly brought
in to explain the most dissimilar manifestations, it assumes
such a general character that it becomes necessary to
supplement it. Let us then, if any importance is attached
to this, assume degeneracy as the soil on which morbid
fears spring up and multiply; then let us seek the complementary
causes, which are less vague and nearer to the
facts. I would propose three such.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The cause is in some event of a man’s previous life <em>of
which he retains the recollection</em>. For example: A man
walking on a terrace on the top of his house failed to
perceive that the balustrade was missing at one spot; he was
walking backwards, and would have fallen over the edge
had he not been stopped; he contracted permanent agoraphobia.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c010'><sup>[137]</sup></a>
A morbid fear of railways is frequently found
in overworked engineers, and especially in men who have
narrowly escaped with their lives in a railway accident.
The well-known case of Pascal seeing an abyss at his left
side, which prevented him from walking forward unless
some one held him by the hand, or a chair was placed for
him to lean on, was a consequence of his accident at the
bridge of Neuilly. It is also said that Peter the Great,
having been nearly drowned when a child, felt, on passing
a bridge, a fear which he had some difficulty in overcoming.</p>

<p class='c017'>We can easily see that many <em>phobias</em> come under this
category. Now, the cause here is only the exaggeration of
a normal fact. Every serious accident leaves behind it a
recollection, which, for some, is merely a bald record of the
event and the circumstances (intellectual memory), for
others, a revival in some degree of the fear formerly
experienced (emotional memory); for “phobic” subjects
it is (at least potentially) a permanent state, ready to
arise when suggested by some association.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c010'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>2. Some morbid fears have their origin in occurrences of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>childhood <em>of which no recollection has been retained</em>. When
appealing to the unconscious memory, we place ourselves in
a fatally unfavourable position; we enter the domain of the
obscure and hypothetical, and lay ourselves open to criticism
of all sorts, all the more so as some writers have made an
excessive use of the explanation by the unconscious. A
minute inquiry into each particular case would be
needed. If, however, this hypothesis is difficult to
justify by means of positive proof, the part played
by the unconscious in psychic life, and particularly
with regard to the memory, is so incontestable that we
may legitimately admit its sure though secret action.
Perhaps those who are seized by strange fears might,
if they questioned themselves, discover the cause in
some past occurrence. Here, at least, is a case which
I give as typical of this group. Mosso asked a soldier,
aged seventy, what he had been most afraid of in his
life, and the man’s reply was, “I have been face to face with
death in many battles; but I am never so frightened as
when I come across a lonely chapel in a remote part of the
mountains; because, when quite a child, I once saw in such
a place the corpse of a murdered man, and a maidservant
wished to shut me up with it as a punishment.”<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c010'><sup>[139]</sup></a> Supposing
the conscious recollection to be gradually effaced with
years, the impression might well remain indelible, though
latent, becoming active under given circumstances. Is it
rash to say that there are many cases of this kind, with this
difference, that the traces leading back to the original cause
have vanished?</p>

<p class='c017'>Cases of strange and insurmountable fear or antipathy
have been noticed in some celebrated men: Scaliger was
seized with nervous trembling at the sight of water-cress,
Bacon fainted during eclipses, Bayle at the sound of
running water, James I. at the sight of a naked sword
(Morel). Among average human beings many like cases
occur, but never become known, for lack of biographers to
record them. I am inclined to think that there lies at the
root of them some impression of early childhood, embedded
in the constitution of the individual, and originating a repulsive
tendency which acts as though it were natural.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>3. The morbid fear may be the result of the <em>occasional</em>
passage of a vague and indeterminate state into a precise
form. Panphobia, mentioned above, might be a preparatory
stage, an undifferentiated period, to which chance, a sudden
shock, for instance, may give a direction and fix it, as in the
fear of epidemics, of microbes, of hydrophobia, etc. This
is the passage from a diffused emotional state to the intellectualised
state, <i>i.e.</i>, one concentrated and embodied in a
fixed idea: an analogous process to that of the “delusions of
persecution,” in which the suspicion, at first vague, attaches
itself to an individual and will not be diverted from him.
The cases, much less frequent than others, in which several
distinct fears coexist, seem to me to be distinguished from
this group. In short, the true cause is a general state (an
emotive condition of fear), but chance plays a great part
in it.</p>

<p class='c017'>I do not pretend to explain everything by means of these
three kinds of causes. When we come to examine the
legion of morbid fears we are often greatly embarrassed
by cases which refuse to come under any of the rules.
Here is a well-known and very trite one: the sight of blood
producing <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malaise</i></span> or even syncope. This is inexplicable
by reason, since the blood is the life; but reason has
nothing to do with the matter. Let us seek elsewhere.
It might be said that blood recalls violent pain, destruction,
slaughter; but its sight affects children who can have no
such recollections. Some have tried to explain it by
constitutional weakness or nervousness, but syncope sometimes
takes place in very vigorous subjects,<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c010'><sup>[140]</sup></a> while
neuropaths remain unaffected. Heredity has been called
in, but I fail to see what it explains, for, going back from
generation to generation, we must come at last to the
primitive men, fighters who were not afraid of blood.
Many other explanations might be proposed, which might
be met by other criticisms.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have cited this single fact in order to show that, so
soon as we pass beyond the enumeration and description of
morbid fears, and try to trace their origin, we enter on a
part of the subject which is almost untouched.</p>

  <h3 id='ch2.3' class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /> ANGER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Anger the conservative instinct in its offensive form—Physiology—Psychology—Anger

stages, one simple, the other mixed—Its evolution—Animal
form, or that of actual aggression—Emotional

do they arise and take a definite direction?—Return
to the reflex state—Essential cause: temperament—Accidental
causes.</i></p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>

<p class='c019'>The instinct of individual conservation, under its offensive
form, is the origin of anger—the type of violent and
destructive tendencies. This emotion is the second in
chronological order, appearing at two months, according to
Perez, and, definitely, at ten months, according to Darwin
and Preyer.</p>

<p class='c017'>Bain defines it as “a conscious impulse which drives one
to inflict suffering and to draw a positive enjoyment from
the fact.” This definition does not seem to me strictly
applicable to the inferior or animal forms of anger, as we
shall see presently.</p>

<p class='c017'>Considered objectively, or from without, anger presents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>itself with very clearly defined characters as regards its
physiology and its mode of expression.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c010'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>1. Dilatation of the blood-vessels, augmentation of the
cutaneous circulation, redness and swelling. This is also
found in joy, but, remarks Lange, with less intensity.
Besides, anger has a special manifestation of its own—<i>i.e.</i>,
the distention of the greater veins, especially on the face
and forehead. In its extreme form (rage) it may cause
nasal or pulmonary hæmorrhage, the rupture of vessels, and
death.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The innervation of the voluntary muscles is increased,
but in an un-coordinated and spasmodic form; the voice is
broken and harsh, the body leans forward in the attitude of
aggression, the movements are violent and destructive;
“one strikes blindly,” the breath comes in gasps with the
well-known symptom of the dilated nostrils, the object of
which, according to Piderit, is that of taking a full breath
while the mouth is shut and the teeth clenched. According
to Charles Bell, it is due to the habitual co-action of
all the respiratory muscles, as the nostrils of an angry
man may be seen to become dilated, although his mouth
is open.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. According to Lange, and in spite of popular opinion,
there is no increase in the biliary secretion; but this is
not the case with the saliva, as is proved by the phrase,
“foaming with wrath.” It is important to note that anger
sometimes gives the secretions a toxic character. Van
Swieten, Bichat, Trousseau, and others have verified this in
the case of the saliva, when the quantity of ptomaine is
augmented; and it has long been known that the bite of
furious animals is dangerous, while analogous facts have
been ascertained in the case of one human being bitten by
another in a fit of rage. The lacteal secretion may also
become toxic, and produce on the nursling the effect of
poison. These facts once more show the close relations
between emotion and physiological or even chemical
phenomena.</p>

<p class='c017'>In short, the organism in general, and the active organs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>in particular, being excited, we may say with Spencer, “that
what we call the natural language of anger is due to a partial
constriction of the muscles which actual combat would call
into full activity, all signs of irritation, beginning with the
rapid shadow which passes over the brow when some slight
cause of irritation occurs, being different degrees of the
same contractions.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Anger and fear form an antithesis, but the former has,
both physiologically and psychologically, a more complex
character. In fact, fear, in all its degrees and throughout
its whole duration, invariably remains within the category of
painful emotions, while anger passes through two stages.
The first, or asthenic, corresponds to the cause, the external
occurrence, the immediate shock, and consists in a short
depression, which is an entirely painful state; the second,
or sthenic, corresponds to the offensive reaction, and, by its
symptoms, approaches much more closely to pleasure than
to pain. We need only remember the sardonic laughter
which accompanies not merely the outbreak of anger, but
some of its mitigated forms, and expresses the joy of seeing
others suffer. Anger is therefore a mixed emotion; it does
not belong altogether to the category of painful states of
consciousness, though the painful side is predominant.</p>

<p class='c017'>Considered as an internal and purely psychical phenomenon,
it eludes description, like every state which defies
further analysis, and, in its acute forms, cannot be seized by
internal observation. It scarcely admits of retrospective
examination. Its psychology is the history of its evolution,
comprising three principal periods:—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The <em>animal</em> form, or that of real aggression. It is
primitive and general. In animals it is seen in a pure state,
because there are no antagonistic, alterative, or restraining
tendencies. Those which live by prey, the voracious
carnivora, present the complete type. Besides the
physiological phenomena already described there is the
actual attack, each species using its natural weapons—teeth,
claws, poisonous liquids. The feeling has the
violence of a hurricane, of an unchained force of nature.
This is because it is connected with extremely powerful
instincts; that of nutrition, which requires its prey, the
struggle for life under its most implacable form, that of
attack—the necessity of destroying or being destroyed. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>this stage the element of pleasure is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span>, or very slight,
because the destruction has a blind and unconscious
character. Bain thinks that monkeys are almost capable
of enjoying the agonies of their victims, and perhaps
elephants also. If this is correct, the fact is only met with
in the case of the higher animals. It is needless to add
that this animal form of anger is seen not merely in savage,
but also in civilised man.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The emotional form properly so called, or that of
simulated aggression. Much less general than the preceding,
this is peculiarly human. Through the preponderance of
the psychic element, or at least, the relative effacement of
the destructive impulses, it appears to me the typical stage
of anger as an emotion. It is frequently seen in the higher
animals; the dog, meeting his enemy, stops, growls,
erects his hair, and offers all the symptoms of aggression in
the nascent stage. Man most usually confines himself to
threats, with some degree of violence, unaccompanied by
destructiveness. The affinity of this form with the first is
evident, and evolutionists have drawn from it a psychological
argument in favour of descent from animals; those
beings nearest to nature—<i>i.e.</i>, the lowest in evolution—are
continually exercising their anger: children on animals
and weak people; savages, coarse-natured people, idiots
and imbeciles on any one who does not resist them.</p>

<p class='c017'>But the important point to note at this stage of evolution
is the definite appearance of a new element—the pleasure of
seeing suffering. With this, anger begins to grow refined.
“There seems little doubt,” says Bain, “that the primary
fact in the pleasure of anger is the <em>fascination for the sight
of bodily affliction and suffering</em>. Singular and horrible as
the fact may appear, the evidence is incontestable” (<cite>The
Emotions</cite>, p. 178). The author goes on to give instances
which need not be repeated.</p>

<p class='c017'>In my opinion, the fact is not so “singular” as the author
supposes, it can be explained if we notice that, at this
juncture, <em>another instinct</em> makes its appearance—one we have
not yet studied, that of domination. We find here the first
germ of a more slowly evolved emotion, that of triumphant
power, of strength, superiority, pride. Henceforth, so
far as psychological analysis is concerned, anger is no
longer in a perfectly pure state. We have the destructive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>instinct <em>plus</em> a variable dose of the satisfied instinct of
domination.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The intellectualised form, or that of deferred aggression.
We may also say that this is the civilised form of
anger. The principal representatives of this group are
hatred, envy, resentment, rancour, etc. We have here two
antagonistic forces confronting one another: on one side
the aggressive instinct which urges forward, on the other,
reason and calculation, which obstruct and restrain the
tendency to attack. The result is an <em>arrest of development</em>.
I do not wish to insist on a point which will be freely
treated later on, in studying the transition from simple to composite
emotions; a few brief remarks will suffice. In biology,
the arrest of development modifies the organ in its function
and structure, and often acts by rebound on other organs;
in psychology the same thing happens, and, in addition,
the arrested development of a tendency modifies its nature
and its reaction on cognate phenomena. Mantegazza (<i>op.
cit.</i>, chap. xiii.) has drawn up a good synoptic table of the
mimicry of hatred. Those who will take the trouble to
study it in detail, comparing it with the expression of outspoken
anger, will understand, better than by means of any
dissertation, what constitutes an arrest of development in
the psychological order, and the modifications which it
involves. I note, among others, one accurately observed
point: the suffering which one inflicts on one’s self, such as
biting one’s hands or gnawing one’s nails; the destructive
tendency when repressed, expends itself internally, at the
cost of the envious man.</p>

<p class='c017'>In this intellectualised form of anger, the feeling of the
pleasure of destruction, realised, or merely imagined,
becomes acute, as proved by the expressions, “tasting his
hatred,” “enjoying his revenge,” etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such are the three stages in this ascending evolution, and
their identity of nature and common basis are clearly shown
by the fact that hatred, if the power of arrest ceases,
becomes outspoken anger; and the latter, if it increases,
assumes the form of actual aggression, thus coming back to
the primitive type.</p>

  <h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c019'>The ancients defined anger as a short madness, which
would relegate it at once and entirely to the region of
pathology. Without qualification, this formula cannot be
accepted. So long as anger is not injurious either to the
individual himself, or to others, it is normal, and even
useful; for an animal or man devoid of any instinct for
active defence and reprisals, would be very poorly
provided. However, it must be recognised that the area of
normal anger is exceedingly restricted, and that no emotion
more quickly assumes a morbid character. Of the three
tests which permit us to judge whether it does so or not, one—that
of violent reaction on the organism—is of no use,
because it gives too much scope to personal estimates and
conjecture. There remain two others: the absence of
rational motives, and chronicity, or excessive duration,
normal anger being only a passing affection. Now, we find
among mental diseases two derivatives of anger, two heightenings
of this condition in paroxysmal form, and we have to
establish between them a psychological difference which is
the repetition of the normal state.</p>

<p class='c017'>Epileptic madness corresponds to the blind, animal, often
bestial form of anger, composed entirely of violent movements
and painful feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'>The maniacal state corresponds to the violent and conscious
form of anger, mingled with a pleasurable element.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. I have nothing to say of the numerous varieties of
epilepsy, its concomitant hallucinations, and its intellectual
and moral consequences; I confine myself to those aspects
which assimilate it to anger.</p>

<p class='c017'>Even in periods of calm, the universally noted psychological
traits reveal a sombre, morose, irritable, but above
all, irascible disposition—the “choleric” character <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par
excellence</i></span>. In the paroxysmal period, we find the symptoms
of anger carried to extremity: “The patient” (I borrow
Schüle’s description) “throws himself on his surroundings
with a blind rage, a bestial fury; he spits, strikes, bites,
breaks everything he can reach, shouts and storms. His
face is congested, his pupils are sometimes contracted,
sometimes—and more frequently—dilated, the conjunctivæ
are much injected, the look is fixed; there is abundant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>salivation, pulsation of the carotid, acceleration of the
pulse.” Where is the starting-point of these discharges of
fury, and by what mechanism are they produced? The
authorities are not at one on this question, some attributing
the principal share in this activity to the bulb, others to the
brain. Recently an auto-intoxication of the nervous centres
has been admitted. However, all this is only indirectly
concerned with psychology. In the ensuing period of
stupor, the acts of blind violence usually leave no trace in
the memory; for it is a sort of psychological law that the
intensity of consciousness should vary inversely as the
intensity of the movements produced.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Mania presents many varieties. Let us take the
typical form, acute mania, the nearest to anger. After a
period of incubation, during which melancholia prevails, a
violent reaction takes place, in sudden paroxysms. The
maniacal state may pass through all degrees, from simple
excitement to fury. Externally, it shows itself, in its milder
form, by continual goings and comings, by an incessant
craving for motion, a possibility of performing active exercise
without feeling fatigue; in the intense form, we have the
symptoms of rage already described: congestion of the vaso-motor
system, redness of the face, violent palpitations of
the heart, foaming at the mouth, furious and destructive
impulses, etc. Internally the case is analogous; it is “chaos
in motion” (Esquirol): and as the principal external
symptom consists of motor disturbances, the principal
internal symptom consists in an intellectual exuberance,
a flux of ideas so disorderly and rapid that they succeed
each other by no fixed rule, and the laws of association
seem to be suspended, and speech, in its impetuous
course, betrays the swiftness and discontinuity of thought.
But there is besides, though not always, an expansive
humour, a state of satisfaction, a feeling of pleasure scarcely
in accordance with the rest. Many, after recovery, declare
that they never felt so happy as during their illness.</p>

<p class='c017'>The cause of this unexpected tendency to joy has been
much discussed. Some attribute it to the superabundance
of ideas, and consequently assign to it an intellectual origin.
This is a fresh example of intellectualist prejudice which
sees but a single effect in the modifications of the emotional
life. Besides, as Krafft-Ebing remarks (vol. ii., sec. 1,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>chap. 2), in delirious fever-patients there is a flow of ideas
without accompanying joyousness, and, inversely, alcohol
may produce gaiety without accelerating the course of
thought; and, accordingly, this author admits—and rightly,
as it seems to me—that these two phenomena, viz., increased
intellectual activity and pleasurable feeling, are subordinated
to a deeper cause; they have their functional basis in an
easier expenditure, and a deceptive sense of power and
vigour, depending on pathological over-activity.</p>

<p class='c017'>These two morbid forms, which have their psychological
prototype in anger, suggest one remark. They are not
evoked by any external excitement, such as the sight of an
enemy, injury, or disobedience. Their cause, whatever it
may be, is internal; it sets going a pre-established mechanism
identical with that of anger (violent and disordered movements,
vaso-motor phenomena, etc.), and the psychic state
which follows is anger, or an analogous emotional form, with
or without a concomitant state of pleasure. This seems to
me a new argument in favour of James’s and Lange’s theory.</p>

<p class='c017'>Epileptic and maniac rages are not the only ones to be
entered under the heading of anger; there is besides these
a group of irresistible impulses of a destructive character
which ought, psychologically, to be included in the same
class. With a difference, however: in the epileptic and
maniac, the physical and psychical symptoms constitute a
complexus similar or analogous to the normal form, and
only to be reckoned as pathological on account of the want
of adaptation and rational motives, while the irresistible
impulses are only partial manifestations—<em>disaggregated forms
of anger</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>Among overpowering tendencies we can only examine at
present those which concern the offensive instinct. I therefore
eliminate those grafted on another stem (dipsomania,
erotomania, kleptomania, etc.) and those which, by their
nature, are inoffensive, ridiculous, or puerile (the incessant
craving for travelling, for counting, for discovering the
names of men and things), and confine myself to those
which have the violent and destructive character of anger,
such as the impulses to wound, kill, destroy, or set on fire
(pyromania). The fatal impulse to suicide will be studied
under another heading (Chap. V.). It is needless to describe
these violent impulses separately, or to recapitulate observations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>which may be found almost anywhere; a sketch of
the characteristics common to all will be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. They pass through a physiological period of incubation,
marked by palpitations and vaso-motor disturbances, rushes
of heat to the head, headaches, præcordial anxiety, insomnia,
agitation, fatigue, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malaise</i></span>, and undefined suffering. 2. The
entrance into the psychological period is marked by the
appearance of a fixed idea. Why one rather than another?
This question will be examined later. The fixed idea,
reigning as a tyrant in the consciousness, gives an aim to
the tendency, determines its orientation. Some maintain
that there are such things as purely intellectual fixed ideas,
with no emotional accompaniment. Others think that the
fixed idea always includes in some degree an emotional state.
I share this second opinion, since every fixed idea is the
beginning of an impulse. 3. The third period is that
when it passes into action, sometimes sudden, more often
preceded by a violent struggle between the overmastering
impulse and the arrestive power of the will.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c010'><sup>[142]</sup></a> There are
some cases where the fixed idea never passes beyond the
second stage; these are abortive forms, of incomplete
development. The passage into action is the rule, it being
a psychological law that every intense representation of a
movement or an act is the beginning of a movement. The
act, whatever it may be, is accomplished, and there results a
feeling of satisfaction, peace, and relief.</p>

<p class='c017'>As regards those destructive tendencies which are to
anger what phobias are to fear, a problem presents itself,
the only psychological problem: that of their origin or
cause. This question I divide into two: How do they
arise? How do they take a determinate direction?</p>

<p class='c017'>I. To explain the origin and appearance of irresistible
impulses, most writers have recourse to the hypothesis of
degeneration. As it is also called in to explain the converse
phenomenon of phobias, it becomes necessary to be a little
more precise. Without entering for the moment on the
discussion of the different interpretations of this vague
word, degeneration, let us take it as synonymous with
dissolution or regression.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The ideal of heredity, as a conservative principle, is to
transmit under a healthy form a healthy organisation, <i>i.e.</i>
(so far as our subject is concerned), one with harmonious
and convergent tendencies. If dissolution is total, we have
the idiot, or the dementia patient. If it is partial, we have
a breach of equilibrium in favour of one or more tendencies.
This disaggregation is not fortuitous; it has a retrogressive
character, it is a return to the reflex movements. It
approaches the character of the animal, the idiot, or the
imbecile; it goes back to that stage of psychic life when the
will under its higher form, the arrestive power, was not yet
constituted.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. In any case, there remains the principal question:
Why was such a tendency predominant? What causes
determined the particular direction taken by retrogression—homicide
in one case, suicide or erotomania in another?
Attempts have been made to explain this by alleging that
every irresistible impulse results from the excessive irritation
of an <em>isolated</em> group of brain-cells. Besides being purely
hypothetical, this explanation is, in spite of its apparent
precision, extremely vague. Is there an isolated group of
homicidal, or one of kleptomaniac cells? This explanation
is really too simple.</p>

<p class='c017'>As far as we can penetrate the very obscure psychological
genesis of the destructive impulses (and this may be held to
apply to the whole group of irresistible tendencies), we find
two sorts of causes at work, the essential and the accidental.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The essential, principal, fundamental cause which,
after the period of physiological incubation, gives a determinate
direction to the tendency is constitution, temperament,
character. It may be admitted, at least theoretically,
that <em>all</em> tendencies exist, actually or potentially, in every
one of us. In ordinary cases, one or more predominate.
Contemporary research has familiarised us with the fact of
the varieties of memory. Such and such a person has an
excellent one for figures, or music, or colour, or form, but
only moderate for everything else. This is a natural gift
singularly capable of being developed by exercise. This
fact has its equivalent in the motor order, or that of
tendencies: there exist natural dispositions only wanting
an opportunity to become preponderant, and morbid
conditions are the culture-medium which favours their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>development. The most violent tendency has its source
in normal life. “There is,” says Gall, “an inclination
gradually rising from the pleasure of seeing anything
killed to the most overpowering desire to kill.” This is
not put strongly enough; it is possible to pass, by imperceptible
gradations, from the extreme case to the normal
state in the following order: the pleasure of killing, the
overpowering desire to kill, the pleasure of looking on at
killing (the sight of a murder, gladiatorial combats, etc.),
the pleasure of seeing the blood of animals shed (bull-fights,
cock-fights, etc.), the pleasure due to the representation of
violent and bloodthirsty melodramas (this is only in
appearance, but the stage always presents a momentary
illusion of reality); lastly, the pleasure of reading bloodthirsty
novels, or hearing accounts of murders, which is
purely an affair of the imagination. We thus pass from the
act to the perception, the simulacrum, the mere image
suggested by signs read or heard. I do not wish to assert,
assuredly, that the spectators of the drama or readers of the
novel are all potential murderers; but, as there are other
men to whom such sights and such reading are abhorrent,
we must recognise certain differences of natural disposition.
Now the peculiarity of retrogression (or degeneration) is to
act on the line of the strongest attraction or the least resistance,
which is a characteristic of reflex action and the
opposite of the inhibitive will, which acts on the lines of
weakest attraction and strongest resistance.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The accidental causes which determine the direction
of a tendency cannot be enumerated, because they vary for
every individual case: we may note sex, social position,
degree of culture, various maladies, etc. Tendencies to
homicide and suicide are apt to spring up in a melancholic
nature; alcoholism favours the incendiary impulse (pyromania);
the epileptic and the general paralytic are more
inclined to theft, and so on. Still more: the same impulse
is variously modified, according to the soil in which it
germinates; “the epileptic kills in a different way from the
hypochondriac, the latter otherwise than the alcoholic or
paralytic” (Schüle).</p>

<p class='c017'>This shows the part played by accidental and consequently
unassignable causes, and is still better shown in the abrupt
substitution of one irresistible tendency for another in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>same individual. Ordinarily, each shows his own special
peculiarity; one constantly repeats his attempts at suicide,
another at theft. But in cases of deep-seated dissolution,
the direction is uncertain. The author of the theory of
degeneration gives an excellent example of this: a hypochondriac
possessed in turn by irresistible impulses to
suicide, homicide, sexual excesses, dipsomania, and pyromania,
and who finally gave himself up to justice, saying
that he was “happy, because his sufferings were about to
end.”<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c010'><sup>[143]</sup></a> We may say of all these overmastering impulses, <em>in
radice conveniunt</em>; and thus the study of those which tend
to destruction has led us, more than once, to speak of the
other kinds.</p>

  <h3 id='ch2.4' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /> SYMPATHY AND THE TENDER EMOTIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Sympathy is not an instinct, but a highly generalised psycho-physiological
property—Complete sense and restricted
sense—Physiological phase: imitation—Psychological
phase: first stage, psychological unison; second stage,
addition of tender emotion—Tender emotion—Its
physiological expression—Its relations with touch—The
smile—Tears: hypotheses as to their causes—Tender
emotion indecomposable.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>Sympathy is not an instinct or a tendency, <i>i.e.</i>, a group
of co-ordinated movements adapted to a particular end,
and showing itself in consciousness as an emotion, such
as fear, anger, sex-attraction; it is, on the contrary, a
highly generalised psycho-physiological property. To the
specialised character of each emotion, it opposes a
character of almost unlimited plasticity. We have not
to consider it under all its aspects, but as one of the
most important manifestations of emotional life, as the
basis of the tender emotions, and one of the foundations
of social and moral existence.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Sympathy, in the etymological sense (σῦν, πάθος), which
is also the complete one, consists in the existence of identical
conditions in two or more individuals of the same or a
different species; or, according to Bain, the tendency of an
individual to enter into the active or emotional states of
others, these states being revealed by certain media of expression.
In its general and original form it is that and
nothing else. We must therefore begin by getting rid of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>prejudice, consecrated by usage in various languages, which
identifies sympathy with pity, tenderness, benevolence, and
the feelings which establish a tie of concord and a state of
reciprocity between two beings. Thus understood, in its
restricted sense, the term sympathy is neither accurate nor
sufficient; for in all benevolent inclinations there are,
besides the general fact of sympathy, other emotional
elements, which will be determined in their proper place.</p>

<p class='c017'>Before it becomes moral, before even it becomes
psychological, it is biological. At bottom, it is a property
of life, and its complete study would be a chapter of
general psychology. If, limiting ourselves to what is
strictly necessary, we try to follow the evolution of
sympathy, from its most rudimentary to its highest forms,
we distinguish three principal phases. The first, or physiological,
consists in an agreement of motor tendencies, a
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>synergia</i></span>; the second, or psychological, consists in an agreement
of the emotional states, a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>synæsthesia</i></span>; the third, or
intellectual, results from a community of representations or
ideas, connected with feelings and movements.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>First Phase.</i>—In its primitive form sympathy is reflex,
automatic, unconscious, or very slightly conscious; it is,
according to Bain, the tendency to produce in ourselves an
attitude, a state, a bodily movement which we perceive in
another person. This is imitation in its most rudimentary
form. Between sympathy and imitation, at any rate in this
primitive period, I see only one difference of aspect:
sympathy everywhere marks the passive, receptive side of
the phenomenon—imitation, its active and motor side.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c010'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>It manifests itself in animals forming aggregates (not
societies), such as a flock of sheep, or a pack of dogs who
run, stop, bark all at the same time, through a purely
physical impulse of imitation: in man, infectious laughter
or yawning, walking in step, imitating the movements of a
rope-walker while watching him, feeling a shock in one’s
legs when one sees a man falling, and a hundred other
occurrences of this kind are cases of physiological sympathy.
It plays a great part in the psychology of crowds, with their
rapid attacks and sudden panics. In nervous diseases,
there is a superfluity of examples: epidemics of hysteric fits,
convulsive barking, hiccup, etc. I omit the mental
maladies (epidemics of suicide, double or triple madness)
since we are only considering the purely physiological stage.</p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up, sympathy is originally a property of living
matter: as there is an organic memory and an organic
sensitiveness, being those of the tissues and ultimate elements
which compose them, there is an organic sympathy, made
up of receptivity and imitative movements.</p>

<p class='c017'>The <i>second phase</i> is that of sympathy in the psychological
sense, necessarily accompanied by consciousness; it
creates, in two or more individuals, analogous emotional
states. Such are the cases in which we say that fear, indignation,
joy or sorrow are communicated. It consists in
feeling an emotion existing in another, and is revealed
to us by its physiological expression. This phase consists
of two stages.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The first might be defined as psychological unison.
If, during this period of unison, we could read the minds of
those who sympathise, we should see a single emotional
fact reflected in the consciousness of several individuals.
L. Noiré, in his book, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ursprung der Sprache</cite></span>, has proposed
the theory that language originated in community of
action among the earliest human beings. When working,
marching, dancing, rowing, they uttered (according to this
writer) sounds which became the appellatives of these different
actions, or of various objects; and these sounds, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>uttered by all, must have been understood by all. Whether
this theory be correct or not (it has been accepted as such
by Max Müller), it will serve as an illustration. But this
state of sympathy does not, by itself, constitute a tie of
affection or tenderness between those who feel it: it only
prepares the way for such an emotion. It may be the
basis of a certain social solidarity, because the same internal
states excite the same acts, of a mechanical, exterior, non-moral
solidarity.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The second stage is that of sympathy, in the restricted
and popular sense of the word. This consists of psychological
unison, <em>plus</em> a new element: there is added another
emotional manifestation, tender emotion (benevolence,
sympathy, pity, etc.). It is no longer sympathy pure and
simple, it is a <em>binary</em> compound. The common habit of
considering phenomena only under their higher and complete
forms often misleads us as to their origin and
constitution. Moreover, in order to understand that this
is a case of duality—the fusion of two distinct elements—and
that our analysis is not a factitious one, it is sufficient
to point out that sympathy (in the etymological sense) may
exist without any tender emotion—nay, that it may exclude
instead of exciting it. According to Lubbock, while ants
carry away their wounded, bees—though forming a society—are
indifferent towards each other. It is well known that
gregarious animals nearly always shun and desert a
wounded member of the herd. Among men, how many
there are who when they see suffering hasten to withdraw
themselves from the spectacle, in order to escape the pain
which it sympathetically awakens in them. This impulse
may go the length of aversion, as typified by Dives in the
Gospel. It is therefore a complete psychological error to
consider sympathy as capable, unaided, of delivering men
from egoism; it only takes the first step, and not always that.</p>

<p class='c017'><i>Third Phase.</i>—Under its intellectual form, sympathy is
an agreement in feelings and actions, founded on unity of
representation. The law of development is summed up in
Spencer’s formula, “The degree and range of sympathy
depend on the clearness and extent of representation.”<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c010'><sup>[145]</sup></a> I
should, however, add: on condition of being based on an
emotional temperament. This last is the source <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>excellence</i></span> of sympathy, because it vibrates like an echo; the
active temperament lends itself less to such impulses,
because it has so much to do in manifesting its own individuality
that it can scarcely manifest those of others;
finally, the phlegmatic temperament does so least of all,
because it presents a minimum of emotional life; like
Leibnitz’s monads, it has no windows.</p>

<p class='c017'>In passing from the emotional to the intellectual phase,
sympathy gains in extent and stability. In fact, emotional
sympathy requires some analogy in temperament or nature;
it can scarcely be established between the timid and the
daring, between the cheerful and the melancholic; it may
be extended to all human beings and to the animals nearest
us, but not beyond them. On the contrary, it is the special
attribute of intelligence to seek resemblances or analogies
everywhere, to unify; it embraces the whole of nature. By
the law of transfer (which we have already studied)
sympathy follows this invading march, and comprehends
even inanimate objects, as in the case of the poet, who feels
himself in communion with the sea, the woods, the lakes,
or the mountains. Besides, intellectual sympathy participates
in the relative fixity of representation: we find a
simple instance of this in animal societies, such as those of
the bees, where unity, or sympathy among the members, is
only maintained by the perception or representation of the
queen.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Tender emotion marks an important stage in the evolution
of affective life; with it we pass beyond the period of the
purely egoistic emotions. The date of its appearance, as
I have said, is not fixed with certainty; it may be at two
months, according to Darwin, who noted at this age one of
his characteristic modes of expression, the smile; more
probably about nine months (Darwin) or twelve months
(Perez), according to definite observations.</p>

<p class='c017'>The physiological expression of tenderness, as far as
movements are concerned, is reducible to a single formula—attraction.
It shows itself either by elementary movements
of approach, or by contact, or by the embrace which is its
ultimate end, of which all the rest are but mitigated and
arrested forms. It therefore stands in relation to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>primordial sense, touch, of which Bain says, “Touch is
both the alpha and the omega of affection.”<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c010'><sup>[146]</sup></a> The movements
have a general character of relaxation, contrasting
greatly with that of anger. One mode of expression which
is specially, if not exclusively, appropriated to it is the smile.
Is this the initial stage of laughter? or is it, on the contrary,
only a weakened form of it, an arrest of development?
This question has been discussed without much advantage.
Darwin adopts the former view, which scarcely seems
reconcilable with the general law of evolution; the child
smiles before it laughs, whereas we should expect to meet
with the inverse order of phenomena. Tender emotion
approximates to joy; and its circulatory and respiratory
modifications are analogous. There is acceleration, as in
the case of pleasure, but to a less degree; tenderness suiting
better with moderate and reposeful sensations.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is also accompanied by an increase in the secretions,
especially in that of the mammary glands in the woman. In
the case of the lachrymal glands this symptom is more difficult
to explain. It is known that tenderness often moistens the
eyes; but tears are produced under conditions so varied,
and sometimes so contradictory, that, even after all the
recent work which has appeared on the expression of the
emotions, the question of the causes seems to me very far
from being exhausted. The pressure of the blood has a
direct influence on this secretion, which is always accompanied
by an increase in the circulation; but the simplicity
of the mechanism is not incompatible with a diversity of
causes. Tears may be provoked by mechanical or physiological
acts: irritation of the conjunctiva, coughing, effort,
vomiting; and by totally distinct psychic states, sorrow, joy,
tenderness. In fact, all attempts at explanation relate to the
painful states only; cases of this kind being, though not of
exclusive occurrence, more frequent than others. Darwin
admits that screaming, in infants, causes the vessels of the
eye to become gorged with blood, and this produces a
contraction of the orbicular muscles as a means of protection,
whence a reflex action on the lachrymal glands;
the shedding of tears continuing even after the suppression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>of the screams. Wundt rejects this explanation,
seeing in the lachrymal glands <em>derivative</em> organs <a id='corr236.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='assuageing'>assuaging</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_236.2'><ins class='correction' title='assuageing'>assuaging</ins></a></span>
pain; this secretion, which is permanent, cleanses
the eye from foreign bodies, such as dust and insects, etc.
As the visual images are the most important of all, the
shedding of tears would be an unconscious effort to drive
away sad representations, having for its foundation an
analogy between the painful sensations and the images.
Whatever one may think of these hypotheses, they consider
tears as signs of pain exclusively.</p>

<p class='c017'>The augmentation of the lachrymal secretion depends on
the increase in the pressure of the blood; now, the circulation
is accelerated by joy and tenderness, as is proved
by the shining of the eyes. The appearance of tears—not
very abundant, however, in such cases—would be the natural
consequence. Sorrow, on the contrary, is accompanied by
a lowering of the circulation, and very often, in the early
stage, tears are entirely wanting. The shedding of tears
produces relief, it is a safety-valve; it would answer to a
second stage—that of slackened tension—in which the
return of vitality has begun. In other words, the tears
of joy and tenderness would correspond to the stage of
action, the tears of sadness to the stage of reaction.</p>

<p class='c017'>The psychology of tender emotion seems to me reducible
to a single question—that of its origin. The description of
its varieties is without interest, and may be found elsewhere.
We have stated it as simple and primary. Being the source
of all altruistic, social, and moral manifestations, it will be
worth our while to consider its nature at the period of its
appearance.</p>

<p class='c017'>In children, and the higher animals, the first manifestation
of tenderness is towards the mother or the nurse.</p>

<p class='c017'>"The relation involved in the sustenance of the child, a
relation only a degree less close than that of the fœtus
to the maternal organism, constitutes in itself the chief
source of the feeling. Along with the supply of nutriment
there goes that of warmth, support, or propping, which
again is a continuation of the fœtal dependence. This first
instinctive or sensuous attachment of the child grows into
what we call fondness by the complication of this instinctive
feeling with numerous “ideal” or transferred feelings, the
product of the many pleasurable sensations, including those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>of the eye and of the ear, of which the mother is the
source."<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c010'><sup>[147]</sup></a> The primary tendency, therefore, is directed,
in children and animals, to those who have been pleasant
to them, or who have done them good, and from whom
they hope to receive it again. This is an emotion which, in
Herbert Spencer’s nomenclature, might legitimately be called
ego-altruistic, or even one with a marked preponderance of
egoism. It must be so, for altruism cannot be innate.</p>

<p class='c017'>The faculty of knowledge begins with an undifferentiated
period, in which there is neither subject nor object, but
only the consciousness of something without qualification.
The separation of the ego and the non-ego in the order of
cognition is the stage corresponding to the division, in the
emotional order, between conscious egoism and altruism.
How does this partial alienation from ourselves come
about? How can it arise and be consolidated? These
questions will be discussed later, when treating of moral
emotion (Chap. VIII.). For the moment, I confine myself
to a single question: Are we confronted with a veritable
instinct—with an innate tendency incapable of being
analysed, showing itself in the consciousness by the tender
emotion or its varieties?</p>

<p class='c017'>We know all the efforts made (especially in the eighteenth
century) to reduce altruism by analysis to an extremely
refined egoism, to a calculation; thus the tenderness of
parents for their children was explained by the expectation
of services to be rendered by them in the future. I think
it needless to insist on this point.</p>

<p class='c017'>In favour of inneity, the best argument that can be
alleged, because founded on fact, is, that affection and
attachment are met with even among animals, to whom we
cannot attribute calculation or interested foresight. Apart
from maternal love, which manifests itself energetically in
very low stages of the animal kingdom, we find examples of
benevolent and active sympathy between animals of the
same species, and even (though this is rarer) of different
species,<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c010'><sup>[148]</sup></a> apart from any sexual attraction. Let us add, if
necessary, in the case of human beings: “the instantaneous,
unreflecting impulses of pity to creatures in distress, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>strangers, enemies, criminals, noxious beasts, the absence of
all balancings of immediate loss with ultimate gain....
Long-sighted selfishness does not explain the conduct of
the Good Samaritan. Again, the hosts of human beings
that in all ages have voluntarily given up their lives for their
country, could not be influenced by their own advantage.
For, although many of these have been taught the hopes of
a future existence, this has been by no means universal;
and there could be little certainty in the mass of minds
that the surrender of this life would receive a full compensation
in another.”<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c010'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The inneity of the altruistic instinct, therefore, seems to
me proved beyond the possibility of reply. It may be very
energetic in some individuals, or very weak in others; in this
it only resembles all instinctive tendencies. As a genus, this
instinct comprises several varieties, of a general character,
such as benevolence, affection, pity, etc. Finally, it is one of
the elements which make up several composite emotions—veneration,
admiration, sexual love, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>It remains only to inquire in what form it first made its
entry into the world, what was its earliest manifestation.
With regard to this matter, there are only three possible
hypotheses: those of maternal love, gregarious instinct, and
the very improbable one of sexual instinct. The value of
these hypotheses will be discussed later on, in the chapter
on moral emotion, which is the natural complement to the
present one.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c010'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c020'><i>Reducible to one primary fact: the feeling of strength or

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The English designate by the term of <em>self-feeling</em>, and the
Germans by that of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Selbstgefühl</i></span>, a group of sentiments
directly derived from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego</i></span>. I scarcely know what to call
them: “personal” would be too vague a term, “egoistic”
too ambiguous (“egotistic” would be better). To identify
them with pride and its opposite would be to restrict them
too far, for they have other forms. We might, for want of
a better, include them under the term <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>amour-propre</i></span> (in its
etymological meaning, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>amor proprius</i></span>), <i>i.e.</i>, satisfaction or
dissatisfaction with one’s self, with its different varieties.</p>

<p class='c017'>Whatever name we may give them, these emotional forms
are reducible to one primary fact of which they are the
embodiment in consciousness—viz., the feeling (well-founded,
or not) of personal strength or weakness, with the
tendency to action or arrest of action which is its motor
manifestation. We can also, but in a less direct manner,
connect them with the instinct of conservation, and say,
with Höffding, that they result from that instinct “arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>at the full consciousness of itself and incarnated in the idea
of the Ego.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This group has its peculiar characteristics. It is almost,
if not quite, exclusively human, while the emotions hitherto
studied have been as much animal as human. It is late in
making its appearance (about the end of the third year),
and is the last in chronological order, except the sex-instinct.
This is because it soon assumes a reflective character, and
because it implies that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego</i></span> is constituted and that the
individual is conscious of himself as such.</p>

<p class='c017'>The <em>self-feeling</em> has two forms, one positive, the other
negative, of which pride and humility may respectively be
taken as the types.</p>

<p class='c017'>Under its positive form, it has a well-known physiological
expression,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c010'><sup>[151]</sup></a> which consists of a series of movements tending
to two ends—(1) Increase in size: the respiration is deep,
the thorax greatly dilated, the gestures eccentric, and, as it
were, aggressive, whence the popular expressions “puffed
up” or “swollen” with pride. (2) Increase in height: the
body and head are held more erect, the gait is assured, the
mouth firmly closed, the teeth clenched; in megalomaniacs,
who present, so to speak, the caricature of pride, these traits
are still further emphasised. Some writers note, besides,
as a specific character, the action of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>musculus superbus</i></span>,
which everts the lower lip.</p>

<p class='c017'>Psychologically, the feeling of strength is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sui generis</i></span> and
irreducible. It is related on one side to joy, being the
sthenic emotion <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span>, on the other to anger,
because the feeling of superiority soon leads to contempt,
insolence, brutality, and the exercise of strength under its
aggressive form. Let us remember that we have, on a
previous occasion, connected with this feeling the pleasure
which frequently accompanies satisfied anger. As it
depends, more than any other primary emotion, on reflection,
its development is determined by intellectual
conditions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Is there any equivalent to it among animals? Certain
facts allow us to suppose that there is. The courteous
contests of pretended battle, the song, the dances by which
the males attempt to captivate the females, the triumph of
some and the defeat of others, must produce some states
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>analogous to pride and humiliation. The arrogant attitudes
of the cock and the turkey-cock, the ostentatious display
of the peacock, are taken as symbols of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>naïf</i></span> pride; and if
the expression of an emotion is that emotion objectivised,
we can easily suppose that it exists in some manner. In
children, the personal feeling is at first connected with the
exercise of physical strength expended in struggling with
each other and in games; later on, with personal appearance,
clothes and ornaments, especially in girls. In consequence
of an increasing irradiation, the self-feeling
envelops everything entering into its sphere of action which
may help to swell its importance—house, furniture, relations.
Later on comes the consciousness of intellectual force, and
the advantages procured by it—fame, power, riches, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>As derivative, or different aspects of egotistic emotion,
under its positive form, we find pride, vanity, contempt,
love of glory, ambition, emulation, courage, daring, boldness,
etc. The special study of each of these feelings belongs
rather to the moralist than the psychologist.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c010'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Under its negative form, personal emotion cannot detain
us long, as it would only be a repetition of what we have
previously studied under the converse aspect. It has for
its basis a feeling of weakness and impotence. It shows
itself by diminution or arrest of movement; its gestures are
concentric, and it consists in belittling instead of aggrandising,
of lowering instead of raising. It is related on one
side to sadness, and on the other to fear; in short, it is the
complete antithesis to the positive form.</p>

<p class='c017'>From this source flow, with different adaptations,
humility, timidity, modesty, resignation, patience, meanness,
cowardice, want of self-confidence, etc. Most of these
manifestations are not simple, but result from the combined
action of several causes, as we shall see later on.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The positive or negative feeling of personal strength is a
normal and healthy emotion when it remains within the
limits of adaptation; for it has an individual and even
social utility.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>For the individual, it is the instinct of conservation become
reflective, and by the consciousness of his strength or weakness,
it permits him to measure his pretensions by his degree
of power.</p>

<p class='c017'>Socially, it makes us in a certain measure dependent on
others. Although strictly egoistic in its origin, <em>self-feeling</em>
cannot develop unless it becomes ego-altruistic, or semi-social.
According to Bain, self-esteem is a reflective sentiment
which consists in judging ourselves as we judge others.
This opinion has been criticised and scarcely seems tenable,
in so far, at least, as it takes away from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>amour propre</i></span> its
instinctive and self-generated character and considers it as a
return action. However, it is certain that the desire of
approbation and the fear of blame are the <em>external</em> elements
which count in the constitution and consolidation of the
feeling of self-complacency; praise gives it extension, criticism
impairs and mutilates it. This does not imply any
great amount of reflection or culture. The child is extremely
sensitive to the judgment of his equals. Primitive man is
imprisoned in a network of custom, tradition, and prejudice
which he cannot break without incurring excommunication;
and those people are very rare who content themselves with
their own approbation only.</p>

<p class='c017'>But from a semi-social feeling, the love of ourselves can
easily become an anti-social feeling. There is no emotion
which passes so simply and definitely from the normal form
to passion, and from passion to madness. At the bottom of
the tendency of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego</i></span> to affirm itself there is a potentiality
of limitless expansion and indefinite radiation. A man
whose self-feeling is vigorous resembles those species of
animals and vegetables which—prolific and of tenacious
vitality—would, if left to themselves, cover the whole surface
of the globe; his expansion is only kept in check by
that of others.</p>

<p class='c017'>Our path towards the pathology of the subject is already
marked out. We have, first, the semi-morbid forms which
have been called the monomania of power. Place a man
in conditions where this tendency to unlimited expansion
meets with no obstacle, and it will go to any extreme.
This is the case with absolute power. No doubt this
unique and, so to speak, superhuman position is not of
itself sufficient. The madness of power (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>folie du pouvoir</i></span>) is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>the resultant of two factors: first, the character, <i>i.e.</i>, the
violence of the egoistic appetites, which, continually satisfied,
continually increase; while the will, the antagonistic,
inhibitive force, keeps on diminishing; and next, external
circumstances—the absence of all restraint, of any equal
power which might overawe by threats. A religious sanction,
or the fear of a political catastrophe, has restrained
more than one, and limited that unbridled tendency which
is only the <i>ego’s</i> feeling of its own power carried to the
acute stage. It is needless to give examples from history,
for they are known to every one.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c010'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Self-feeling, under its positive form, has its ultimate incarnation
in a well-known pathological manifestation—the
delusion of greatness, or megalomania. Perhaps, indeed, in
this case, the exaggeration produced by disease shows itself
most clearly and without altering the original.</p>

<p class='c017'>Megalomania is met with in general paralysis of the
insane as a transitory phase; but especially in systematised
chronic delusions (<em>paranoia</em>). We may pass over the period
of incubation, which is often melancholic; thus, in a case of
persecution-delusions, the patient is at first tormented by
vague suspicions; he accuses no one in particular, he has
as yet no accredited enemies; but one day he discovers
them, and nothing will ever divert his thoughts from them
again. Then, in some cases, the disease passing through
another evolutionary stage, he arrives, by logical deduction,
at the conclusion that it is his great merit, his high position,
which are exciting jealousy. Thenceforth megalomania is
fully developed; the subject thinks himself a millionaire, an
unrecognised genius, a great inventor, a king, the pope, or
even the Deity.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is nothing more characteristic than such a description
as the following, which has often been drawn up, and
is yet another proof that emotion, its expressive and its
physiological bases, are but parts of the same phenomenon.
“He walks with head erect, with assurance; his speech is
laconic and imperious, he seeks solitude, and is full of
contempt for the society which surrounds him. His style
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>of dress is in accordance with the tendency of his aberration.
Like the maniac, he is restlessly active; but, in him, no
movement is fortuitous or without a motive; his will
is always active, his actions have a definite aim; if
he shows violence, it is in order to ensure the execution of
his commands, to show that he has strength sufficient to
annihilate everything; it is not a destructive spirit which
animates him, but the necessity for showing his power.
The functions of the assimilative life have undergone no
alteration; they take place, as a rule, with perfect regularity.
It seems as if the expansive form of their feelings, their
contentment with themselves, the extreme and unbroken
satisfaction surrounding their life, imparted to the organic
vital apparatus a surplus of activity, resulting, in a manner,
in an excess of health.” Frequent cases of longevity
among megalomaniacs have been noted. Finally, the
following observation has its value, on account of the
change—at once organic and psychic—there recorded:—"We
have watched a patient who, after having suffered
from melancholia for several years, suddenly became
megalomaniac. His constitution had undergone great
alterations, and his health was much weakened, so that he
became a chronic melancholic; but so soon as his mental
affection took on the character of megalomania he was not
long in acquiring new vigour."<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c010'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>We might add that the tendency of men is rather to
pride, of women to vanity, which favours the views of those
who maintain that madness is often only the exaggeration of
the habitual character: it is sufficient to have shown that
the feeling (though illusory) of personal strength in an
extreme degree is only the normal state amplified, but not
changed.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>
<p class='c019'>It may seem strange to close this chapter by some
remarks on a phenomenon which, both by its internal
and external characteristics, belongs to the class of irresistible
tendencies—the fatal impulse to suicide. Its affinity
with homicidal obsession is undeniable, as is proved by the
persons who are tormented, in turn, by the craving to kill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>others and to kill themselves. However, if self-love, in its
positive form, reaches its culminating point in megalomania,
it seems to me quite legitimate to maintain that self-feeling,
under its negative form, attains its supreme negation in
suicide.</p>

<p class='c017'>Without insisting on a merely accessory point, it is
certain that suicide, as a manifestation of emotional life,
brings us face to face with a psychological problem as
yet insufficiently noticed. If there is an incontestable
fact—one which, even among the ancients, was familiar
to triteness—it is that in every animal the fundamental,
ineradicable instinct is that of self-preservation, of existing,
and persisting in existence. Now, suicide, whether
voluntary or unreflecting, deliberate or impulsive, is the
negation of the fundamental tendency, not a theoretic or
partial negation, or one in word only, but in deed and
absolute. And the sacrifice of life is not subordinated to
some other end which acts by superior attraction, such as
devotion to a belief, to friends, to humanity, to one’s
country, it is a suppression pure and simple, a liberation
desired in and for itself.</p>

<p class='c017'>The ethnological, moral, and social study of suicide does
not form part of our subject, having already been fully
worked out.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c010'><sup>[155]</sup></a> Our aim is merely the psychological problem,
which we must now define with more precision.</p>

<p class='c017'>The act of suicide results from two very different mental
states, that of reflection and that of impulsion.</p>

<p class='c017'>In deliberate, reflective, voluntary suicide there is a
struggle between two factors: the instinct of conservation
and the insupportable state caused by pain (incurable
disease, ruin, misery, grief, frustrated ambition, dishonour).
Reflection decides, and as pain is always a beginning of
destruction, it prefers a total and rapid destruction to a
partial and slow one. The act is rational, since it tends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>towards the lesser evil, or at least what is judged to be
such.</p>

<p class='c017'>Impulsive suicide is harder to explain. A man throws
himself suddenly out of a window, poisons himself, cuts
his throat. In some cases death has been premeditated,
but always appears as a compelling, inevitable force, inexorably
claiming its victim; the epithet “irresistible”
says everything. To the outside spectator the act appears
motiveless, without reason, without cause. It is all the
more surprising that the struggle, in this case, is no longer
between instinct and reflection, but between two instincts,
the conservative and the destructive, of which the one which
usually is the strongest succumbs, and the individual turns
against himself the destructive tendency originally destined
to act on others.</p>

<p class='c017'>Yet the psychology of deliberate suicide gives us the
key to that of the impulsive variety. What in the first case
results from conscious, clear, reasoned motives, results in
the second from blind, obscure, unconscious states: it is an
act of organic life, and its cause is found in cœnæsthesia.
Impulsive suicide is the expression of the destructive
process, slow, permanent, dimly felt, going on in the
depths of the organism. Any one who presses in rage on
an aching tooth, who rolls on the ground, strikes his head
against the wall, or mutilates himself, is attempting an instinctive
though absurd reaction in order to get rid of his
pain. These are modified forms, it is true, but they will
serve to show that the man who yields to an overmastering
impulse to strangle or drown himself seeks a deliverance of
the same kind.</p>

<p class='c017'>Leaving degeneration (which is perpetually being dragged
into this question) out of account, observation shows us
that the difference between the two forms of suicide is
reduced to that between psychic and purely organic causes.
Impulsive suicide flourishes best on the soil of melancholia
and hypochondria—<i>i.e.</i>, in states which involve
deep dejection and a disorganisation of vital action. We
may also notice the part played (as was long ago pointed
out) by heredity, the descendants of suicidal ancestors often
killing themselves at the same age and in the same manner
as the latter;<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c010'><sup>[156]</sup></a> now, psychological heredity is based on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>organic. Finally, the automatic character of these impulses
approximates them to the class of reflex actions, attempts
at suicide being repeated in the same form during a
recurrence of the same circumstances—<i>e.g.</i>, somnambulism,
intoxication, the menstrual period. All these characteristics
assign to irresistible suicide an organic origin, which
is equivalent to saying that its ultimate cause lies in
temperament. The conservative instinct exists in all men,
but it may exist in any degree. In some there is an innate
joy of life capable of resisting all disasters; in others, a
constitutional melancholy, or (which comes to the same
thing) <em>the conservative instinct is very weak</em> and yields to
the least shock. Impulsive suicide represents self-feeling at
its last stage of regression, or, in other words, at its negative
extreme.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Its physiology—Its evolution: Instinctive period—Emotional
period (Individual choice)—Intellectual period (Platonic
love)—Its pathology—How can sexual instinct deviate
from the normal course?—Anatomical and social causes—Psychological
causes: (a) unconscious, (b) conscious.</i></p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The sex-instinct, the last in chronological order with man
and the higher animals, gives rise to the emotion of love
with its numerous individual varieties. Most psychologists
have been very sparing of details where it is concerned, and
one might mention certain voluminous treatises which
contain no mention of it. Is this through exaggerated
delicacy? Or is it because the authors think that their place
has been usurped by the novelists who have so obstinately
confined themselves to the study of this passion? But the
novelist’s mode of analysis is different from the psychological
mode, and does not exclude it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Sexual love being an emotion whose evolution is complete,
it is impossible to determine the physiological and
psychical signs suiting all cases, from the blind instinct to
the most refined and intellectualised forms. Nevertheless,
there are certain specific characters which it always preserves,
one special mark which is never effaced throughout
its various metamorphoses, and that is, its origin. For the
moment, let us take as typical the common and average
forms which, as we shall see later on, are met with half-way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>as we follow the evolution of sexual love from the lowest to
the highest.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Though neither James nor Lange has cited it among
his typical cases, love is certainly one of the emotions which
express most clearly the state of the organism, and offer the
clearest proof in favour of their theory. Let the reader
suppress, in imagination, all the physiological manifestations
which accompany it. What remains? not even the consciousness
of a vague attraction, for that supposes an actual
or nascent movement.</p>

<p class='c017'>Love, as a sthenic emotion, presents physical characteristics
which connect it on the one hand with joy, on the
other with tenderness, which have already been described.
The circulation is accelerated, sometimes to an extreme
degree, the respiration likewise, and they react on the
organic functions. (We have already seen how, in many
animals, the period of love corresponds to deeply-seated
chemical modifications—usually of a toxic character—in
the organism.) We find, further, movements of mutual
repulsion, or of mutual attraction, the dominant part played
by touch resumed in its essential organ, the hand, caresses,
embraces, fusion; the movements of attraction being all the
more noisy and violent, in proportion as the instinct predominates.
Finally, as the specific mark, we find a particular
state of the sexual organs, varying from slight excitement to
paroxysm. This disturbance,—whether strong or weak,—even
when it has no echo in the consciousness, influences
the unconscious activity.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c010'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>If from the organic, motor, and vaso-motor manifestations
we pass to the nervous centres, where impressions are
received and movements initiated, we can find scarcely anything
but hypotheses. One point only has been fixed since
Budge’s researches: the existence in the spinal cord of a
centre or an area on the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra,
which governs the movements of the sexual act. Its psychological
function is slight or non-existent: it is properly an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>instinctive centre, whose action is not obstructed by the
removal of the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, in
the inferior vertebrates, and even in the dog, as proved by
the experiments of Goltz and others. Some authors admit,
without precise localisation, a second centre, situated near
the ganglia at the base of the encephalon, which they
suppose to be the seat of the brute sensations and their
corresponding movements, and in relation with the centres
of olfactory and visual sensations. This centre would have
a psychological value. Lastly, a third and last centre in
the cortical layer, the organ of perception properly so called,
and of the revival of images. Nothing precise is known as
to its position, whether it is localised in a certain area, or
diffused. On this point we find nothing but hypotheses—if
so much as that. The occipital lobes, the neighbourhood
of the olfactory centre, have been suggested, but these are
extremely doubtful. We have to be content with the
admission that, from the genital organs, impressions are
first transmitted to the lower or spinal centre, which
exercises a reflex action on the corresponding systems of
vascular, motor, and secretory innervation, and thence—whether
there is an intermediate centre, or not—reach the
cerebral cortex, where they produce a more or less definite
state of consciousness, according to circumstances.</p>

<p class='c017'>Anatomy and physiology are not the only sciences concerned
in this question; for if the existence of these superposed
centres, connected with each other, though distinct in
function, were thoroughly established, this would give us
certain landmarks, and lay down fixed conditions, or stages,
in the development of sexual emotion, which may result
from a state of the organs (instinctive form) or from an
external perception, or from a pure representation (imaginative
love). In the absence of an anatomical basis which
might serve for the normal psychology of the subject, and
still better for the comprehension of the pathological facts,
let us follow the evolution of sexual love so far as observation
enables us to do so. It has already been sketched in
the Introduction, but too briefly for our present purpose.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. We have distinguished, in this psychological evolution,
three principal periods: the instinctive, the emotional, and
the intellectualised.</p>

<p class='c017'>Taking the question at its remotest origin, some naturalists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and philosophers assert that the equivalents of sexual attraction
exist in living beings devoid of nervous systems, in
vegetable or animal micro-organisms. “It is curious,” says
Balbiani, “to find, in beings who from their small size, and
the external simplicity of their organisation, have been
placed by all zoologists at the furthest limit of the animal
world, actions denoting the existence of phenomena
analogous to those by which the sex-instinct manifests
itself in a great number of metazoa.... Thus, with
the paramæcids, at the moment of propagation ... a
higher instinct seems to govern these little animals; they
seek and pursue each other, they go from one to another,
feeling each other with their cilia, cling to one another for
some instants in the attitude of sexual approach, and then
let go in order to seize each other again. These singular
games, by which these animalcules seem in turn to provoke
one another to the act of copulation, often last for several
days before the act becomes definitive.” Other facts of the
same nature have been cited. Finally, it has been said that
“the coupling of the two sexual elements is analogous to the
coupling of the two animals whence these elements are
derived: the spermatozoid and the ovule do on a small
scale what the two individuals do on a large one; the
spermatic element, in directing itself towards the ovule
which it is to fertilise, is animated by the same sexual
instinct which guides the complete being towards the female
of the same species.”<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c010'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>If we confine ourselves to the micro-organisms, these
facts of sexual attraction have been interpreted in two ways,
as we have already seen—one psychological, the other
chemical. Some, as we have just heard, admit a desire, an
elective action, a choice, quoting in support of this not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>only the phenomena of generation, but several others: as
the habitat, the use of a certain substance in the formation
of the carapace, the movements of certain micro-organisms
in seeking and seizing a determined prey. Others reject
this psychology, which they call anthropomorphism, and
maintain that chemical action is sufficient to explain the
whole. Pfeffer had already shown, as far as generation is
concerned, that the spermatozoids of the cryptogamia are
attracted by certain chemical substances varying according
to the vegetable species. More recently, Maupas and
Verworn, who have successively studied the alleged cases
of choice, eliminate all psychical elements and reduce the
whole to a purely mechanical process. I am inclined to
adopt the second opinion, while recognising that, as far as
problems of origin are concerned, we decide by probabilities
rather than proofs.</p>

<p class='c017'>Above this chemical or organic attraction we find the sex-instinct
properly so called, which, with its numberless
adaptations, embraces the whole animal world. It is
useless to prove that this instinct is fatal, blind, not
acquired, anterior to all experience; but, as by its nature
it consists essentially of motor manifestations, its psychology
is scanty enough. Some remarks on this point may not be
without advantage. In fact, as regards the problem of
instinct, an entirely new position has been taken up.</p>

<p class='c017'>During the first half of this century the inneity of instinct
was placed in the order of cognition, while recent
psychology places it in the order of movements, or, to be
more accurate, in a fixed relation between certain states of
consciousness and certain movements. According to the
first hypothesis, stated in a masterly manner by F. Cuvier,
instinct consists in images, or innate and constant sensations,
which determine to action in the same manner as
ordinary sensations; it is “a sort of vision, a dream,
analogous to somnambulism.” According to the second
hypothesis, sensations, perceptions, and images excite movements
determined by the organisation, as in the case of
ducklings when they see the water, the kitten scenting a
mouse, the squirrel laying up its winter store. There are
no innate representations, or even innate movements, but a
pre-established relation between some fortuitous impressions
and a group of movements: instinct is the <em>innate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>motor reaction</em> to an external or internal excitement; it
results from the nature of the animal. The impression
only pulls the trigger and the shot is fired. Like every
other instinct, that of sex consists in a fixed <em>relation</em>
between internal sensations coming from the genital organs,
or tactile, visual or olfactory perceptions on the one hand,
and movements adapted to an end on the other. As far
as it is an instinct, it is that and nothing but that. In the
immense majority of animals, and frequently in men, it
does not rise above this level; in plainer words, it is
not accompanied by any tender emotion. The act once
accomplished, there is separation and oblivion. More than
this, in some cases there is not even indifference, but
hostility: the males of the queen bee are put to death as
useless, and it is well known that the mate of the female
spider often runs the risk of being devoured.</p>

<p class='c017'>Sexual <em>love</em> corresponds to a higher form of evolution.
Over and above instinct, it implies the addition of a certain
degree of tender feeling. It is not therefore a simple
emotion, even in the tolerably numerous species of animals
in which it can be studied. In man, more especially in
civilised man, its complexity becomes extreme. The
analysis made by Herbert Spencer is well known and
somewhat lengthy, yet I do not hesitate to transcribe it,
since I can find no other to equal it, nor any point which
could be added or subtracted:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c017'>“... The passion which unites the sexes ... is habitually
spoken of as though it were a simple feeling; whereas it is
the most compound, and therefore the most powerful, of all the
feelings. Added to the purely physical elements of it are first
to be noticed those highly complex impressions produced by
personal beauty, around which are aggregated a variety of
pleasurable ideas, not in themselves amatory, but which have
an organised relation to the amatory feeling. With this there
is united the complex sentiment which we term affection—a
sentiment which, as it can exist between those of the same sex,
must be regarded as an independent sentiment, but one which
is here greatly exalted. Then there is the sentiment of admiration,
respect, or reverence; in itself one of considerable power,
and which, in this relation, becomes in a high degree active.
Then comes next the feeling called love of approbation. To be
preferred above all the world, and that by one admired beyond
all others, is to have the love of approbation gratified in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>degree passing every previous experience, especially as there is
that indirect gratification of it which results from the preference
being witnessed by unconcerned persons. Further, the allied
emotion of self-esteem comes into play. To have succeeded in
gaining such attachment from, and sway over, another, is a
proof of power which cannot fail agreeably to excite the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>amour
propre</i></span>. Yet again, the proprietary feeling has its share in the
general activity: there is the pleasure of possession; the two
belong to each other. Once more, the relation allows of an
extended liberty of action. Towards other persons a restrained
behaviour is requisite. Round each there is a subtle boundary
that may not be crossed—an individuality on which none may
trespass. But in this case the barriers are thrown down, and
thus the love of unrestrained activity is gratified. Finally, there
is an exaltation of the sympathies. Egoistic pleasures of all
kinds are doubled by another’s sympathetic participation, and
the pleasures of another are added to the egoistic pleasures.
Thus, round the physical feeling forming the nucleus of the
whole, are gathered the feelings produced by personal beauty;
that constituting simple attachment, those of reverence, of love
of approbation, of self-esteem, of property, of love of freedom,
of sympathy. These, all greatly exalted, and severally tending
to reflect their excitements on one another, unite to form the
mental state we call love. And as each of them is itself comprehensive
of multitudinous states of consciousness, we may
say that this passion fuses into one immense aggregate most of
the elementary excitations of which we are capable; and that
hence results its irresistible power.”<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c010'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>This evolutionary moment gives the complete type of
love. As it goes on, a breach of equilibrium is produced
at the expense of the physiological and instinctive elements,
which gradually efface themselves before a more and more
intellectualised image.</p>

<p class='c017'>Certainly, there lies at the root of all love the unconscious
search for an ideal, but for an ideal perceived in a concrete,
personal form, incarnate for the moment in an individual.
By a process of mental abstraction similar to that which
draws from perceptions the most general ideas, the concrete
image is transformed into a vague scheme, a concept, an
absolute ideal, and we have a purely intellectual, Platonic,
mystical love; the emotion is totally intellectualised. Let us
remark that this last stage of evolution is not so very rare.
Not only do we meet with it sporadically, but it has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>fixed and expressed, at certain moments of history, in
institutions, such as the chivalric love, of which Geoffrey
Rudel seeking the Lady of Tripoli is the most perfect
example; the troubadours, the Provençal Courts of Love,
deciding that true love cannot exist in marriage, and
excludes all cohabitation, etc. We must not, however,
allow ourselves to be misled by appearances. Platonic and
mystic lovers have always maintained that their sentiment is
perfectly pure, and has nothing in common with the senses;
the contrary opinion seeming to them a profanation and
a sacrilege. Yet how could love exist without physical
conditions, however attenuated we may suppose them? If
they are wanting, all we have or can have is a purely
intellectual state, the representation of an ideal conceived
but not felt. Besides, we have more satisfactory evidence
than suppositions and arguments; facts of tolerably frequent
occurrence show how rapidly we may fall from the ideal
plane. It is only because all the circumstances are in its
favour that the fall is so easy.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c010'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>In this ascending evolution from the instinctive to the
idealistic form there is a decisive moment—viz., the
appearance of the individual choice. This is the special
criterion which differentiates instinct from emotion. Sexual
instinct contents itself with a specific satisfaction; sexual
love does not. And as choice manifests itself among
the superior representatives of the animal kingdom, not
only by sanguinary combats between the males, or by
the more pacific tournaments which precede sexual selection,
but, in the absence of all rivalry and competition,
by the exclusive preference of one male for one female,
chosen among many others whom he might possess, we
may admit <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a fortiori</i></span> that primitive humanity must very
soon have left behind the stage of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Venus Volgivaga</i></span>. We
know that Schopenhauer, and after him Hartmann, have
tried to determine the reasons of choice; but such attempts
must always be partial failures, because we can never be sure
of discovering all the unconscious factors.</p>

<p class='c017'>For the rest, the psychology of love contains many
other mysteries. Whence comes the blind violence which
astonishes and sometimes terrifies the calm spectator?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Bain thinks it can be explained by the concentration of
the attention on an individual, and by the fact that intensity
and unity of object are associated in love. But this applies
also to other passions, such as ambition and hatred. Herbert
Spencer, in the analysis already quoted, attributes it to the
complexity of the passion, love being an aggregate of heterogeneous
tendencies all converging to one end and carrying
the individual in the same direction. At bottom, the irresistible
element is in the sexual instinct, and only exists in
virtue of it; instinctive activity alone has such power. This
is what Schopenhauer calls, in metaphysical terms, the Genius
of the species, which makes of the individual an instrument
for the furtherance of its ends. We might also call it, in
biological terms, according to the hypothesis of Weismann
now in vogue: the continuity of the germ-plasm which
energetically manifests and affirms itself, safeguarding the
rights of the species against individual fancies. But all
these metaphors explain nothing, add nothing to the simple
verification of the fact. Sexual instinct remains the centre
round which everything revolves; nothing exists but through
it. Character, imagination, vanity, imitation, fashion, time,
place, and many other individual circumstances or social
influences give to love—as emotion or passion—an unlimited
plasticity. It is the task of the novelists to describe
all its various shapes, and one which they have not failed to
perform.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Though love, even in its average manifestations, is inseparable
from obsession and impulsion, I see in these two
characteristics no legitimate reason for placing it unrestrictedly—as
some writers have been pleased to do—in the
category of pathology.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c010'><sup>[161]</sup></a> It has its natural end, and tends to
fulfil it by appropriate means. Every one knows that it
sometimes reaches the confines of madness; but in this it
does not differ from the majority of the emotions. There
are the impulsive and irresistible forms of love (erotomania),
but they remain within natural limits; the true pathology of
love is elsewhere—outside nature.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>On the deviations and interversions of the sexual instinct
so many observations have been published,—especially in
our own day,—so many books written, so many medico-legal
theses discussed, that we might think the psychology of the
subject had thereby been cleared up. Nothing of the sort;
and it is this alone which interests us.</p>

<p class='c017'>Reduced to its simplest expression, the psychological
problem is this: The sex-instinct having a clearly-defined
and easily-verifiable end, how can it deviate therefrom?
Other instincts—that of conservation under its offensive and
defensive forms, that of self-feeling—have no mechanism
exclusively appropriated to them, and are susceptible of
various and multiple adaptations. This, on the contrary,
is confined by nature within strict limits. No doubt every
instinct has its oscillations; but it is only the means which
vary, the end remains the same. The ant, the bee, the
beaver, the spider, modify their manner of acting in accordance
with their environment, because they are confronted
with the dilemma that they must either adapt themselves
or perish; but they always arrive at the same end. The
nutritive instinct in man utilises animals and vegetables—the
raw caterpillars of the savage or the scientific cookery of
the civilised man—but the same end is always aimed at and
attained. With the deviations—at least the extreme ones—of
the sex-instinct it is otherwise: everything changes, means
and end alike. The normal end, generation and the perpetuity
of the species, is ignored or annihilated. This
aspect of the question does not appear to me to have been
sufficiently noticed. How can an instinct so solidly based,
and having its own special mechanism, go astray?</p>

<p class='c017'>This subject deserves a purely psychological monograph,
a very difficult piece of work for which this is not the
proper place. I would only seek to inquire into the
principal causes of the alteration of this instinct. I shall
cite no facts—they are sufficiently well known, or will suggest
themselves; besides, the choice lies between excessive
abundance and nothing. I pass over the extreme cases,
those of necrophily, or of sexual erethism accompanied by
a craving for violence, destruction, or blood. These are the
equivalent of the animal manifestations already mentioned,
in which the state of general excitement, so far from producing
tenderness, awakens by preference the aggressive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>tendencies. These are merely insane impulses. I am
limiting myself to deviations and interversions—<i>i.e.</i>, to cases
where the natural mechanism of instinct is falsified (excitations
caused by impressions having nothing to do with
sexuality, attraction towards the same sex, etc.).</p>

<p class='c017'>We may pass over in silence the general causes, which
are not particularly instructive: degeneracy, brought in, as
usual, to serve as an explanation, and heredity, which is no
explanation at all, being merely a repetition, and brings us
back to the primary case, which states the question afresh.
The inquiry can only be profitable when directed to particular
causes.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. One principal anatomical and physiological cause is
found in the conformation of the genital organs: arrest of
development, incomplete sexuality, hermaphrodism, malformations,
etc. This is the simplest and most easily
verifiable cause, and is found to be sufficient in some cases.
The action, from below upwards, of the organ and its lower
centre on the brain, is no longer normal; the conditions of
existence of the instinct are absent or altered.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Other causes are not so easily assignable. One of a
sociological order may be indicated: it is known what takes
place when a number of individuals of the same sex are
shut up together, as in boarding-schools, convents, prisons,
barracks, ships on long voyages. But the most numerous
causes are of psychological origin, and we may divide them
into unconscious and conscious.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The existence of the unconscious, and therefore involuntary,
causes is rather suspected than proved. They
consist in strange associations of ideas formed at the period
of puberty, whose ultimate reason eludes observation; they
might be compared to certain cases of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>audition colorée</i></span>, when
a connection is formed between a sound and a colour,
apparently fortuitous, but in reality resting on a common
emotional basis. More than this, observation seems to
show that, at a much earlier age, in the fifth or sixth year,
there are apt to occur “unconscious genital impulses provoking
associations of ideas which frequently serve, in later
years, as a <em>substratum</em> to our sentiments and volitions. Most
of these associations are unstable, and remain outside the
consciousness. In the degenerate they take on the impulsive
and overpowering character which distinguishes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>their psychology; their intensity expresses the degree of
consciousness which accompanies them, the recollection
which is still connected with them, even the importance
they assume in later existence. The existence of an
unconscious sub-personality directing the conscious one
manifests itself here rather than elsewhere with undeniable
clearness.”<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c010'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>4. There remain the conscious voluntary causes which are
the converse of the physical causes, representing an action
from above downwards of the superior centres on the
inferior centre and the organs. It is here that instinct
finds itself in conflict with its most redoubtable enemy,
the intense and persistent image. In predisposed subjects
the creative power of the imagination works at some construction
on an erotic theme, as in others it produces a
mechanical invention, a work of art, a scientific discovery.
Every vivid image tends to realise itself; in the present case
it has the power to divert instinct from its natural channel
if its motor power is stronger, and the sexual instinct has
not in all men an equal stability.</p>

<p class='c017'>I do not think, however, that these causes are sufficient
to explain everything, even if we take account of imitation
which fixes itself in custom, and of the contagion of example.
If the facts were taken in detail, omitting nothing, we should
meet with more than one embarrassing complication. Thus,
sexual aberrations are found in animals, though of but
moderate intelligence and living quite free from constraint.
Can we, considering this, throw all the blame
on imagination? They are also found among primitive
races: the Huns, say ancient historians, had made of
unnatural love a regular institution; can we blame civilisation?
Many other difficulties of this kind might be raised;
but I may remind the reader that pathology is only introduced
into this work by way of elucidation, and it seems to
me that, in the present subject, it receives from normal
psychology more light than it throws on it.</p>

point out that a simple emotion (fear, anger, etc.) is, in
itself, a very complex phenomenon, and that “simple”
means irreducible by analysis to any other emotion. All
those which do not present this characteristic are complex.
The problem to be stated, then, is this: How have the
secondary and derivative emotions arisen from the primary
or principal ones? Since it is admitted that these are
typical emotions, and, on the other hand, the observation
of human life shows us numerous emotional states, with
their individual varieties and gradations, their transformations
in the course of ages, how has this multiplicity
been produced?</p>

<p class='c017'>It is under this form that the masters of the seventeenth
century had stated the question, and I take it up again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>because this method seems to me far superior to that of
classifications, which has since become prevalent. We
know that Descartes admitted only six primary passions:
admiration, love, hatred, desire, joy, and sadness. “All the
others,” he says, “are composed of some out of these
six, or else they are different species of the same, and
derived from them;”<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c010'><sup>[163]</sup></a> and he goes on to describe about
forty. Spinoza admits only three principal: desire, joy,
and sadness, whence he deduces the others, which, after
eliminating some repetitions, amount to forty-six. However,
it is not very clearly shown by what method these
philosophers determine their primary passions; it seems
as though the criterion were their extremely general
character, except in the case of admiration. As for the other
passions, they are <em>deduced</em>, and in order to show this clearly,
Spinoza always takes care in his definitions to connect the
primary with the derived passion. Thus: “Fear is an
ill-assured sadness, arising from the idea of some past or
future thing of which we are in some doubt as to the result.”
In short, their method is geometrical and deductive,
especially in the <cite>Ethics</cite>; but we can, with slight modifications,
adapt it to the exigencies of experimental psychology.
Thus we have determined the primary emotions by derivation,
from the chronological order of their appearance, not
by their extremely general character. As for the derivative
emotions, we are about to seek to determine the very
various conditions of their genesis, not by way of deduction,
but by that of analysis or synthesis based on observation,
<i>i.e.</i>, as far as possible by a genetic method. We have
elsewhere spoken of classification and the insurmountable
difficulties inherent in it; accordingly, the aim which we
propose to ourselves is not, given a composite emotion, to
determine its genus and species, but to know <em>from what
primary emotion, and in what manner, it is derived</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>These natural methods of transition from the simple to the
complex seems to me capable of being ranged under three
heads: (1) evolution, (2) arrest of development, (3) composition
(mixture and combination). These three methods
may act separately or conjointly; the more complex emotions
are usually the result of their co-operation. We shall
examine them in succession.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>
  <h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c019'>The transition <em>by evolution</em>, complete or incomplete, is
the simplest and most general case. It consists, like all
evolution, in the passage from simplicity to complexity, from
the undifferentiated to the differentiated, from the lower to
the higher. It depends on the intellectual development,
and is based on the law of transference already described
(Pt. I., chap. xii.), which is its active and unconscious instrument.
However feeble the development of the emotions
may be in any race or individual it is never entirely wanting
(idiots excepted), because the events of national and individual
life have always some variety and some changes of
aspect, which influence the emotional life.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is convenient to distinguish two cases, according as the
evolution takes place in a homogeneous or a heterogeneous
form.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. <i>Evolution in homogeneous form.</i>—The primary emotion
remains identical with itself, through the whole course of
evolution; it only increases in complexity. Here are some
examples:<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c010'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Æsthetic emotion has its origin in a surplus of activity
expending itself in a particular direction, under the influence
of the creative imagination; and it preserves this fundamental
character from the drawings scratched on flints by
quaternary man, or the symbolic dances of savages, through
the classic ages, to the quintessential refinements of the
decadents. It is true that all are not disposed to admit
this: a person of delicate artistic temperament, brought up
in a very cultured environment, and suddenly thrown into
the midst of savage æsthetics, would deny any community of
nature, but in this he would be mistaken. Those centuries
which had no sense of evolution, of the continuity of development
(the seventeenth and eighteenth), could see nothing in
the origin of art but incomprehensible crudities, not worth
notice. The transition from simplicity to complexity took
place through the accumulation of knowledge, of ideas, and
technical skill, and of causes or occasions of new ways of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>feeling: thus were formed juxtaposed aggregates acting by
quality and quantity. This progress from simplicity to
complexity is seen better than anywhere else in the development
of the feeling for music, the most emotional of all
the arts.</p>

<p class='c017'>The religious sentiment is not of simple origin. It
results: (1) from the fusion of two primary emotions—fear,
and love in the larger sense (tender emotion); it is therefore
a binary compound; (2) from a process of evolution which
we shall have to follow in detail and which depends on
intellectual conditions: predominance, first, of images,
then of inferior concepts, then of superior concepts.
Here, too, the continuity escapes the notice of many who
do not see the bond connecting fetichism with the most
idealistic of religions. How many travellers and ethnographers,
after having ascertained the existence, among a
given tribe, of magic, amulets, funeral rites, seriously affirm
that these people are devoid of all religious feelings! It is
because for them complex and highly organised forms are
the only ones that count, and because they are accustomed
to think of religious feelings as formulated by the great
established religions.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. <i>Evolution in heterogeneous form.</i>—The primary feeling
is transformed to such a degree as to become unrecognisable,
and can, in many cases, only be recovered by laborious
analysis. This case resembles that of the morphological
development of animals: the forms of the adult give no
hint of the forms of embryonic and fœtal life.</p>

<p class='c017'>The best example I can give is the genesis of the
benevolent emotions, which, however, will be more suitably
placed in the next chapter. We can, however, examine
another case.</p>

<p class='c017'>The instinct of conservation is, as we have seen, a collective
term, an abridged formula, used to designate the
totality of particular tendencies which assure the persistence
of the individual, and one of which, the craving for food, is
fundamental. It manifests itself in all its simplicity in most
animals and in savage tribes who live, strictly speaking, from
day to day. Yet ants, bees, foxes, and many other animals
put aside a reserve store of food for future needs. The
human race has very rapidly acquired the habits of foresight
and care for the future, even while still in the savage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>stage and living by hunting and fishing. With a nomadic
or agricultural life, the need of possession affirms itself more
and more. As social progress substitutes for exchanges in
kind the use of the precious metals, first in ingots, then as
coined money, and later still, of paper money, feeling follows
the same course, transferring itself from things to the values
which represent them and the representations of these
values, in many cases with well-known tenacity; and we
see people who prefer illness to the expense of a cure,
the risk of being murdered to the unpleasantness of giving
up their purses. So that those values and signs of values
which represent the possibility of satisfying needs (food,
clothes, lodging, etc.), become in and for themselves a cause
of desire and pleasure, and, amassed as a security for life,
remain useless—if, indeed, they do not cause death.
Avarice is a passion very well suited to illustrate this
evolution in heterogeneous form, which, in spite of a strictly
logical development, undergoes so many changes that its
extreme point seems the negation of its point of departure.</p>

<p class='c017'>The feeling of strength, self-feeling in its positive form, is
at first, as we have seen, the consciousness of physical
energy; but, with the intellectual development, it radiates
in different directions, according to temperament and disposition.
We can at least note two very different directions:
(1) an evolution in the theoretical and purely individual
sense, which leads a man to take up all questions,
examine and criticise everything, form an independent
opinion on every subject—in short, to have as his ideal an
absolute liberty of thought, without any sort of restriction;
(2) an evolution in the practical and social sense, extending
one’s power over things and men; the child who domineers
over his playmates may, at a later age, impose his personality
on a party, a nation, a number of nations (Cæsar,
Napoleon). The quality of the emotions felt in the two
cases is very different; however, the original source is common
to both, the divergence is the effect of character and
intellectual evolution.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The transformation of simple into derivative emotions,
<em>by arrest of development</em>, is of less frequent occurrence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>While, in the preceding case, there was a forward movement
in a straight line, intellectual evolution involving
emotional evolution according to the law of transference,
here the mental process is more complicated; it supposes
an antagonism between two states of consciousness, resolving
itself into a compromise. There are, on the one
hand, emotional tendencies going in the direction of impulse;
on the other, images, ideas, intellectual states of all
sorts acting by way of arrest, so that the resultant emotion
is composed at the same time of movements and inhibitions
of movement.</p>

<p class='c017'>Except fear, all primary emotions imply tendencies to
movement, sometimes blind and violent, like natural forces.
This is seen in infants, animals, savages, the Barbarians of
the first centuries of our era as depicted by contemporary
chroniclers; the passage of emotion into action, good or
bad, is instantaneous, rapid, and fatal as a reflex movement.</p>

<p class='c017'>Reflection is, by its nature, slow and inhibitory. How
can an image or a conception produce an arrest of movement?
This is a very obscure question, the psychological
and physiological mechanism of which has had but little
light thrown on it; it is useless to treat it here in a cursory
manner; we need only remark that the arrest exists as a
matter of fact.</p>

<p class='c017'>The intervention of this new factor, reflection, may result
in two ways. On the one hand, it may obstruct and finally
suppress; thus a passion kept in check ends, after various
oscillations backward and forward, in being altogether extinguished.
The second is a transformation or metamorphosis
by arrest of development; the passion is not
extinguished, but it has changed its nature.</p>

<p class='c017'>The biological sciences have familiarised us with the notion
of arrested development and the morphological modifications
resulting therefrom. We know that the parts of a living
being are so closely connected that none can change without
involving a change on the part of the others; such is the
formula of the “Law of Organic Correlations,” and it has its
equivalent in the functional order. The “compensation of
development” exists beyond all doubt in psychology, though
it has not been as much studied as it deserves; thus
experience shows us that hypertrophy of certain faculties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>entails as a consequence the hypertrophy or atrophy of
certain others.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have previously (Chap. III.) mentioned hatred as an
abortive form of anger, the result of arrested development.
I have only to add a few supplementary remarks on the two
antagonistic elements. One is primary and tends to the
partial or total destruction of the enemy, attacking him in
his own person or in that of his friends, in his reputation,
his honour, his interests. The other, made up of reflection
and calculation, consists in the representation of consequences,
in the fear of reprisals and of Divine or human
laws. Hence arises an emotional state comparable to the
movement of a body rotating on itself and incapable of
passing certain limits; and it must be admitted that the
metamorphic process is here very thorough-going, since
many writers, so far from grasping the affinities between
hatred and anger, set up the former as a primary emotion,
the antithesis of love. Yet it is very clear that hatred, by
the inhibitory character peculiar to it, is not and cannot be
a primary emotion; it corresponds to a second stage. If it
is objected that we might as well assert that anger is the
developed form of hatred (<i>i.e.</i>, that the latter is primary),
and not hatred an abortive form of anger, I should answer
that this position is inadmissible, because in experience we
have no example of the inhibitory form appearing <em>before</em> the
corresponding impulsive form. What is primary is an instinctive,
unconscious movement of retreat, of aversion (in
the etymological sense), but this is no more the emotion of
hatred than the instinctive and unconscious movement of
attraction is the emotion of love.</p>

<p class='c017'>Resignation, with its varieties and gradations, is an
abortive form of grief. Its mode of expression has been
described in detail by Darwin (Chap. XI.). This state is
the resultant of two currents: on one side, moral pain, grief,
which by itself and in its complete form shows itself in prostration,
tears, etc.; on the other hand, an intellectual notion—that
of the irreparable and irremediable, of the futility of all
efforts. The intellect has its teleology, which is not that of
feeling; if it prevails and asserts itself in the consciousness,
we shall have, after a period of oscillation, a fixed state, in
which the loss will be accepted and perceived in a mitigated
form.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Mystic, platonic, or intellectual love (there is no advantage
in distinguishing the exact shades expressed by these various
epithets) is, as we have seen, an abortive form of sexual
love. Predominance of the intellectual element, the conceived
ideal; weakening of the physiological and emotional
manifestations and the organic erethism, of the tendency to
movements of contact and embrace, and everything which
constitutes emotion in its plenitude: such are its characteristics.
Here, more than elsewhere, the term “arrest of
development” is strictly accurate, because mystical love
results, not from a voluntary inhibition which mutilates or
checks emotion, but from an impotence on the part of
emotion to develop its complete form.</p>

<p class='c017'>Experience furnishes the counterproof: let the antagonistic
action of reflection, or of the intellectual state—whatever
it may be—cease, and hatred will once more become
anger, resignation grief, or despair; mystical will change to
sexual love, and the primitive form reappears under the
ruins of the derivative.</p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up, all the emotions of this group whose genesis
depends on an arrest of development are reducible to a
single formula: <em>intellectualised emotions</em>, because the intellectual
element becomes dominant. We might also call
them <em>attenuated</em> emotions, because they tend towards
emotional weakening. The two contrary and reciprocally
dependent tendencies peculiar to this group, determine,
not a medium emotion, but a new form which, relatively
to the primary emotion, and to the general quantity
of emotional life, is a <em>loss</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Transformation <em>by composition</em> is a general term including
two different cases: mixture and combination. This process
consists of additions, and can be thus formulated:
When two or more intellectual states coexist, each having its
own peculiar emotional colouring, there arises a complete
emotional state; in other words, intellectual complexity involves
emotional complexity. If we compare the primary
emotions to the simplest perceptions of sight and hearing,
the complex emotions will correspond to the perception of
an extensive landscape or a symphony. It is thus formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>by the addition or fusion of binary, tertiary, quaternary
compounds, and so on, these terms implying the number of
simple emotions which compose them. The composition
may be brought about in two ways, which we shall distinguish
by calling them respectively mixture and combination,
in the sense in which these words are employed by
writers on chemistry.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. <i>Composition by mixture.</i>—In the emotions derived
from this mental procedure, the constituent elements can
be recovered from the compound; they embrace without
interpenetrating one another, and a psychological analysis
conducted with sufficient thoroughness is able to determine
and enumerate them. For greater clearness, I distinguish
two cases in the mixture of feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>a.</i>) The elements are homogeneous or convergent. If
they are numerous, since they all tend in the same direction,
the resultant emotion will be of great intensity. We have
found one example of this in sexual love, an aggregate
compound (according to Herbert Spencer’s analysis) of
physical attraction, æsthetic impressions, sympathy, tenderness,
admiration, self-love, love of approbation, love of
possession, and desire of liberty.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>b.</i>) The elements are heterogeneous or divergent. As
an example I take jealousy, which many authorities consider
primary, perhaps because it is manifested by animals
and infants, which simply proves that it is precocious,—quite
a different thing. A contemporary writer tries to define it
by saying: “It is a morbid fear passing from inert stupidity
to active or passive rage.” I greatly prefer Descartes’
definition: “Jealousy is a kind of fear related to the desire
we have of keeping some possession” (<cite>Passions</cite>, art. 167).
This passion deserves a monograph to itself, and one will
certainly be written when this style of work comes to be
applied more frequently to the psychology of the emotions.
Our task at present is not to study its gradations, from
mild cases up to madness and homicide, but to inquire
into its composition. There is, firstly, the representation
of some good, possessed or denied—a pleasurable element
acting by way of excitement and attraction; and, secondly,
the idea of dispossession or privation (<i>e.g.</i>, of the lover with
regard to his mistress, of the rejected candidate against his
fortunate rival, and in general, of any who fail against all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>who succeed), an element of vexation which acts depressively;
and, thirdly, the idea of the real or imaginary cause
of this dispossession or privation, awakening, in various
degrees, the destructive tendency (anger, hatred, etc.). In
the passive or inert forms of jealousy this last element is
very slight. This emotion is, therefore, a binary compound.</p>

<p class='c017'>We might further mention the religious sentiment (a
binary compound), the feeling of respect, composed of
sympathy and a slight degree of fear, and the moral
sentiment, which we are about to analyse in the next
chapter.</p>

<p class='c017'>I must remark that these derivative emotions, by
reason of their complexity, ought logically to show as
many shades of variety as they have constituent elements.
In sexual love, where analysis discovers at least
ten tendencies, whether primary or not, the predominance
of one or more among these changes the aspect of the
emotion according to times and individuals. The instability
of the passions, of which we hear so much, is partly
caused by their composite character.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. <i>Composition by combination.</i>—The emotion resulting
from this mental procedure differs, in its nature and
characteristics, from its constituent elements, and appears
in the consciousness as a new product, an irreducible unit.
Here the analysis, uncertain and hazardous as it often is,
cannot give us everything which we find in the synthesis—a
psychological case which has well-known equivalents in
chemistry.</p>

<p class='c017'>A Danish psychologist, Sibbern, whom I believe to have
been the first to point out this mode of composition of the
emotions under the name of mixed sentiments, defines
them as “Those in which the disagreeable excites the
agreeable, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>, so that one is not antecedent to
the other, but both act simultaneously, and the disappearance
of the one involves the disappearance of the other.”<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c010'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
In fact, there is not merely coexistence, but reciprocity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>action; if you suppress a single term the emotion changes
its nature, as we shall see by the following examples.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the emotion accompanying all forms of activity in
which we <em>seek</em> great difficulties to overcome, or risks to run
(as in hunting wild animals, dangerous mountain climbing,
exploring expeditions, etc.), if we suppress the unknown
element, the risk, the danger, there is no longer any
attraction. If we suppress this attraction and its accompanying
pleasure we have nothing left but fear or disgust.
This particular emotion exists only through the interdependence
of its various elements. It can be produced in
a modified form, but without changing its nature, in the
spectators of bull-fights, wild beast tamers, violent struggles,
and thrilling dramas, and in a lesser degree by mere recitation
or reading.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have already mentioned melancholy (in the ordinary,
not the medical sense) as one form of the luxury of grief.
It implies the calling up of pleasant states, past or distant,
<em>plus</em> a state of present sadness which surrounds them.
Suppress one or other of these elements and the melancholy
vanishes. If the pleasurable element, however slight, disappears,
nothing remains but grief pure and simple. In
this combination sometimes the one element predominates,
sometimes the other, and the resultant feeling receives a
special emotional <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>timbre</i></span>, as the case may be.</p>

<p class='c017'>The feeling of the sublime is usually considered as a
form of the æsthetic sentiment, and we shall have to return
to it later on. Whatever it may have for its object—whether
the spectacle of sullen glaciers, of a boundless
desert, or of a man who throws himself recklessly into some
great act of self-devotion,—it is composed of discordant
elements fused into a single synthesis: (1) a painful feeling
of oppression, of lowered vitality, of annihilation, which
drags us down and depresses us; (2) the consciousness of
an upward rush, of unfolded energy, of an inward lifting up,
of an increase of vital power; (3) the conscious or unconscious
feeling of security in presence of a formidable
power. Without the last-named the emotion would
change its nature, and we should feel fear. These three
co-existent and interdependent elements enter collectively
into the consciousness, and present themselves to it as an
irreducible unit.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Höffding (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 407) gives humour as an example of
a combination, or, as he calls it, a mixed feeling. He
defines it as “the sentiment of the ridiculous based on
sympathy.” This state consists in seeing simultaneously
and indissolubly the petty side of great events and the
great side of the most trivial things. It is the synthesis of
two antithetic elements: the destructive and contemptuous
laugh which makes us feel ourselves superior; and the
indulgence, pity, and compassion which place us on a
footing of equality with others. This emotional manifestation
may be simply a passing whim, or it may be a
permanent trait of character, a peculiar manner of understanding
nature and human life, striking an average between
optimism, which finds everything too bright, and pessimism,
which sees the ugly side of everything. The school of
“irony,” which, with Solger, Schlegel, and others, played its
part in German æsthetics at the opening of this century,
proposed humour—negative and destructive in form,
positive and constructive in reality—as its fundamental
principle in the interpretation of the universe.</p>

<p class='c017'>I am inclined to place in this group an emotional state
which has given rise to many dissertations and discussions—I
mean modesty. I look upon it as a binary compound
capable of being resolved into two primary emotions: self-feeling
and fear. Whatever may be thought of this explanation,
the subject is worth the trouble of a little
examination; it could scarcely be omitted from a treatise
on the psychology of the feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is no lack of documents respecting the manifestations
of modesty among different peoples; they may be
found in the narratives of travellers, and in works on
anthropology and ethnology. The psychological question
of its nature and origin has been treated by Spencer, Sergi,
James, Mantegazza, to mention contemporary writers only.
The last-named even gives us a definition of it: “Modesty
is physical self-respect.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It has a physical mode of expression peculiar to it, or at
least only met with in the emotions related to modesty
(shame, timidity, shyness), viz., the sudden redness of
the face due to momentary paralysis of the vaso-constrictor
nerves. We know Darwin’s ingenious explanations of this
point: a person who thinks others are looking at him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>directs his attention to his own face, whence results a
flow of blood towards that part. These explanations are
now rejected. The experiments of Mosso and others on
the circulation of the blood rather justify the view taken by
Wundt, who sees in the momentary relaxation of the vaso-motor
innervation, causing the redness of the face, a
compensation for the accelerated pulsations of the heart,
produced by emotion.</p>

<p class='c017'>Besides this special mode of expression, modesty shows
itself by concentric, defensive movements, by a tendency to
cover or disguise certain parts of the body. The means
employed to this end are of the most various description,
according to race, country, or period: some hide the whole
body, some the sexual parts only, or the face, or the bosom,
some paint the body, or the face, etc. It is impossible to
determine the exact part played in this diversity by circumstances,
climatic conditions, the association of ideas,
compulsion, fashion, imitation, and even chance.</p>

<p class='c017'>So far as psychology is concerned, it is especially the
question of origin which has been discussed: Is modesty
an instinct? is it innate or acquired, primary or derived?
Some writers, rather carelessly, assume that it is an instinct,
on no other evidence than its quasi-universal character,
which they deduce, legitimately enough, from its multiple
manifestations. Most, however, adopt the contrary opinion,
alleging the example of children, and of certain primitive
races who seem totally devoid of it. This second view
seems the more tenable, though it is difficult to find a
categoric solution which is free from objections. Modesty,
being an ego-altruistic feeling (and the same applies to
shame and shyness), presupposes some degree of reflection.</p>

<p class='c017'>The conditions of its origin are little understood. H.
Spencer, and, after him, Sergi, maintain that it results from
the habit of wearing clothes, which began with men (not
with women) from motives of ostentation and ornament.
There are tribes where both sexes go naked, others where
clothing is the privilege of the male sex: immodesty would
thus be, in its origin, a lack of æsthetic feeling. Exclusively
appropriated, at first, to the male sex, the feeling of modesty
would then have transferred itself to the other. This explanation
seems very precarious, not to mention the theory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>incidentally implied, that the feeling is not stronger in
women than in men.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c010'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>W. James proposes another, which is less simple, but
more acceptable.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c010'><sup>[167]</sup></a> Briefly, it is this: The emotional state
which lies at the root of modesty, shame, and other similar
manifestations, arises from the application in the second
instance to ourselves of a judgment primarily passed upon
others. The sight of certain parts of the body, and the
ideas which they suggest, inspire repulsion, and “it is not
easy to believe that even among the nakedest savages an
unusual degree of cynicism and indecency in an individual
should not beget a certain degree of contempt, and cheapen
him in his neighbours’ eyes.” (In our opinion, this psychological
state approximates to disgust, of which we have
already seen the causes and the significance.) What is
repugnant to us in others must be repugnant to them in us:
whence the habit of covering certain parts and concealing
certain bodily functions. Modesty cannot be considered
an instinct in the strict sense of the word, <i>i.e.</i>, as an excito-motor
phenomenon. Under the influence of custom, public
opinion, civilisation, it passes through its evolution, till it
reaches “the New England pitch of sensitiveness and range,
making us say stomach instead of belly, limb instead of leg,
retire instead of go to bed, and forbidding us to call a
female dog by name” (James, ii. p. 437).</p>

<p class='c017'>Taken as a whole, this emotion approximates most by
its external symptoms to fear. It also contains elements
derived from self-feeling. Must we add other elements
derived from the sex-instinct? This is only admissible in
certain cases. In short, its composition is variable. We
cannot consider it as instinctive, primitive, innate. On the
other hand, analysis cannot clearly resolve it into its
constituent parts; we are inclined to see in it a particular
case of mental synthesis, a combination.</p>

<p class='c017'>To conclude, with regard to the emotions formed by
combination:—</p>

<p class='c017'>They are based on an association of intellectual states,
which is, in most cases, an association by contrast.</p>

<p class='c017'>They presuppose a fusion, in varying proportions, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>agreeable and disagreeable states, which justly entitles
them to be called mixed emotions.</p>

<p class='c017'>The whole differs from the sum of its constituent
elements.</p>

<p class='c017'>Analysis ascertains and isolates these elements, but
cannot boast of having discovered them all.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the moment of beginning the study of the composite
emotions which have had the most brilliant career, and
played the most important part in human life, it will be well
to indicate the course which will be followed, once for all.
We cannot, in dealing with the social, moral, religious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>æsthetic and intellectual sentiments, discuss the numerous
questions which they suggest, and so lose ourselves in endless
details. The allotted task of psychology seems to me to
be quite clearly defined—viz., to take each feeling <em>at its
origin</em> and try to determine its nature and follow its development,
in its principal phases, by the help of the documents
supplied to us by ethnology, and the history of morals, of
religions, and of æsthetic and scientific culture, thus avoiding
vagueness and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> reasoning, without losing our way in
an inextricable tangle of facts.</p>

<p class='c017'>In conformity with this plan, we shall begin with the
simplest forms of the social instinct in animals, passing
from them to man, and thence to the evolution of moral
tendencies.</p>

<p class='c019'>Even if we admit the transformist hypothesis, zoological
evolution has not proceeded in a straight line. This point,
it is true, is contested, but it is all the more important to
remember, because the development of the organisation and
that of the social instincts do not always go on <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pari passu</i></span>.
Thus the social aptitudes of ants and bees are far superior
to those of certain mammals considered of a far higher
type of organisation. Without troubling ourselves, therefore,
about the frequent disagreements between zoological
taxinomy and sociological psychology, we shall follow the
ascending march of the social instinct, no matter in what
order or class or at what point of the genealogical tree it
shows itself.</p>

<p class='c017'>We thus find four principal forms of animal societies:
at the lowest stage, those founded on nutrition; further on,
those based on reproduction; then, unstable, gregarious
societies; and finally, societies with a stable and complete
organisation.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c010'><sup>[168]</sup></a> Some special question will be put with regard
to each of them, so as to show us the social question under
some one particular aspect.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The idea of a society,” says Espinas, “is that of permanent
co-operation between separate living beings, engaged
in the same action” (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 157). The character of
permanence even is not necessary for the inferior forms;
there are temporary societies differing <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in toto</i></span> from those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>heterogeneous, fortuitous, momentary aggregates which
we call crowds. Reciprocity and solidarity are the two
fundamental conditions, a fact which excludes from
human and animal societies two forms somewhat approximating
to them: parasites, in whose case there is no
reciprocity, and who show a modified form of the struggle
for life; and messmates, where community of life, though it
involves no injurious action, likewise implies no helpful
one.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. In animal societies founded on nutrition, it is this
function which constitutes the social tie; the individuals
composing it are attached to one another in a permanent
manner, from their birth onwards, and the nutritive liquid
circulates from one to another, thus establishing a material
community. It is found in the hydroid polypes, the
Bryozoa and the Tunicata. As examples of the superior
forms, we may quote the hydractinia, composed of individuals
each of which has its own special and exclusive
function: some, that of feeding; others, that of feeling and
exploring; others, of defending the colony; others, again, of
reproducing it—the last-named being divided into males and
females. The siphonophora present an analogous division
of labour, and the community, over a metre in length,
suspended to a floating bladder, executes well co-ordinated
collective movements.</p>

<p class='c017'>Is there—at any rate in the higher forms of these colonies—a
social instinct? Solidarity and reciprocity can indeed
be perceived, in an objective, material way, in the form of
adherence, and vascular communication; but nothing proves
that there is anything more than an <em>organic</em> solidarity and
reciprocity. Perhaps, in circumstances such as the nautical
manœuvres just mentioned, in which a general obedience to
one directing individual has been ascertained, there is a
momentary consent—a certain unity of representation.
To be accurate, the terms individual and community are
diverted from their ordinary acceptation and used in an
equivocal sense. Our notion of the individual is that of
an organised whole living independently by itself: this no
longer corresponds to the present case. Our notion of a
community is an assemblage of individuals, and as these
are, in the case under consideration, of a peculiar nature,
it might thus be contended with equal force that these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>aggregates deserve, or that they do not deserve, the name
of animal communities: it is a question of the point of
<a id='corr278.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='view'>view.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_278.3'><ins class='correction' title='view'>view.</ins></a></span> On the one hand, one may regard the hydractinia
or the siphonophora as a complex individual whose organs
are the fishing, the piloting, the reproductive, etc., individuals.
On the other hand, it may be maintained that the food-providers,
pilots, etc., are true individuals whose aggregation
forms a society. In short, it is an undifferentiated state, in
which individuals and community are hardly to be distinguished
from one another, and are only two different aspects
of the same whole. The social instinct, also, if existing at
all, is not yet differentiated from the conservative instinct
under its simplest forms—the search for food, defence,
attack. In fact, the two coincide. This stage has nothing
more to teach us. Let us now pass on to social forms
whose psychology is clearer.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. These are the societies founded on reproduction—domestic
societies, or families, under their various forms. I
prefer to begin with these rather than with the gregarious
state; first, on account of their universality; then because
they are the first to appear in chronological order. Common
opinion finds in them the first manifestation of the social
sentiments, their origin, their source, and their moment of
entry into the world. I reject this view in order to adopt
that which connects the social instinct with the gregarious
state.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we take, one after another, the conditions of every
aggregate founded on reproduction, we shall find three
stages: that of sexual approach, that of maternal love, and
lastly, but in the case of animals only exceptionally, paternal
love. The social instinct—<i>i.e.</i>, the more or less vague consciousness
of at least a temporary solidarity and reciprocity—does
not, as we shall see, make its appearance at any of
these stages.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Sexual approach results from one particular instinct;
it unites two individuals only: can we consider it as the
embryo of a society? “Around sexuality are co-ordinated
the altruistic instincts of which the animal is capable.”
This formula of Littré’s needs defining with more precision.
First, in the immense majority of cases the connection is
not lasting; the blind instinct satisfies itself, and all is over.
Higher up there are more permanent forms, such as polygamy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>and polyandry; but these small communities founded
on sex-attraction are closed, and have no power of radiation
or extension, no future. Higher still we find monogamy,
as among wolves, many birds, etc.; but the monogamic
aggregate is still more of a close corporation than the
others. Let us note, in passing, that these two forms,
polygamy and monogamy, are distributed through the
animal world in an apparently fortuitous manner, having
no relation to the intellectual development—as, for instance,
the monogamy of the stork and the polygamy of
the monkey.</p>

<p class='c017'>Finally, this first stage yields us no result, tending rather
towards social restriction than social extension.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Maternal love is of much greater importance. In
domestic societies it is the universal and permanent element,
the vital bond. This emotion is so widespread, so well
known, we might say so trite, that it seems to involve no
mystery, and yet, if we descend into animal psychology,
we find nothing more enigmatical. The development of
sympathy and intelligence partly explains it in the human
species and the higher animals; but in the lower orders the
difficulty becomes extreme. Yet it shows itself among the
annelids, the crustacea, the mollusca, and even the echinoderms,
which carry their eggs about adhering to their bodies.
Frequently it shows itself as a feeling which, though vague,
is tenacious, devoted, heroic. We do not indicate all the
difficulties of the question, as for instance: How can an
insect take such care of its eggs when it cannot recognise its
own form in a creature which in nowise resembles itself, and
has not even a living form?<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c010'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Most naturalists content themselves with ascertaining the
fact, without inquiring into its origin. Darwin declares that
it is useless to speculate on this subject. Others connect
maternal affection with parasitism—scarcely a legitimate
hypothesis, since the parasite is the enemy of its host and
lives against his will at his expense. Romanes seems to
have recourse to the principle of serviceable variations;
an animal which takes care of its eggs or carries them about
with it, has a better chance of preserving them; and if this
way of acting becomes a fixed habit in its descendants, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>instinct has been established. This explanation reduces
itself to chance and to the hereditary transmission—an open
question—of acquired modifications.</p>

<p class='c017'>Excluding the insects and those analogous cases which,
as Espinas has shown (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 334-339), require a special
explanation, it is preferable to admit, with this author and
Bain, the prominent part played by contact. “It seems to
me that there must be at the foundation that intense pleasure
in the embrace of the young which we find to characterise
the parental feeling throughout. The origin of the pleasure
may be as purely physical as in the love of the sexes; ...
[there is] an initial satisfaction in the animal embrace,
heightened by reciprocation.”<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c010'><sup>[170]</sup></a> “The female, at the
moment when she gives birth to little ones resembling
herself, has no difficulty in recognising them as the flesh
of her flesh; the feeling she experiences towards them is
made up of sympathy and pity, but we cannot exclude from
it an idea of property which is the most solid support of
sympathy. She feels and understands up to a certain point
that these young ones which are herself at the same time
belong to her; the love of herself extended to those who
have gone out from her changes egoism into sympathy and
the proprietary instinct into an affectionate impulse. As
sexual love implies the idea of mutual ownership, so maternal
love supposes that of subordinated ownership. It is because
this other self is so feeble that the interest felt for it takes
the form of pity.”<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c010'><sup>[171]</sup></a> This last remark relates to an emotional
manifestation which Spencer regards as the source of
maternal love—tenderness for the <em>weak</em>. This seems to me
rather one of its elements than its sole basis. On the other
hand, Bain maintains that “an intensified attraction towards
the weak is not merely consistent with the gregarious situation,
but seems to be required by its varying exigencies....
An interest or solicitude about weak members would
be almost the necessary completion of the social system”
(Bain, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 138, 139). This granted, maternal love
and social instinct would have an element in common,
but they nevertheless remain distinct and mutually independent.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have insisted to some extent on maternal love, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>it is one of the most important manifestations of the emotional
life. It is clear that it belongs to the category of the
tender emotions, of which it is a well-determined form and
remarkable by reason of its intensity; but it is not the
source of the social instinct, because it implies neither
solidarity nor reciprocity. It might be maintained that it
is the gate by which the feeling of benevolence made its
entrance into the world, and that its appearance is the
earliest in date; but other conditions are needed for the
social instinct to reveal itself.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The third stage, marked by the entrance of the father
into the domestic community, does not affect our conclusion.
In the animal world taken as a whole, paternal
affection is rare and far from permanent, and among the
lower representatives of humanity the feeling is a very weak
one and the tie very loose. It exists, however, and its
origin is much more difficult to assign than in the case of
maternal love.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c010'><sup>[172]</sup></a> Though it may be maintained that in man
it originates in pride and the feeling of ownership (Bain),
this hypothesis is not applicable to animals; we cannot say,
as in the case of the mother, that there is a material and
visible relation, so that the offspring seems to be a separated
portion of the parent. It remains to establish the significance
of sympathy for weakness, as a primary cause of this feeling.
We might add another element if we admit, with Spencer,
that the life in common of the father and mother (paternal
affection being only found where unions are permanent)
creates a current of affection in proportion to the services
rendered. Whatever origin we may assign to it, it adds
nothing to our discussion, and has no efficacity in arousing
the social instinct.</p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up: what we find at the base of domestic
aggregates is tender emotion, the genesis of altruism, but
restricted to a closed group, without expansive force or
elasticity.</p>

<p class='c017'>III. The gregarious life—<i>i.e.</i>, that of the animals who
live in troops or hordes—is founded on the attraction of
like for like, irrespective of sex, and for the first time
manifests the true social tendencies, through the habit of
acting in common.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>In its lowest degree it consists of accidental and unstable
assemblages which are, as it were, an attempt at life in
common. Every one knows that certain pelagic animals
travel in vast numbers, their course being determined by
the temperature of the water or the direction of the
currents. We also know what happens in the migrations
of processionary caterpillars, of crickets, and more especially
of birds. Numerous species of animals assemble together
in the morning and evening to sing, utter their various
cries, pursue each other and gambol about, living dispersed
at other times. This shows, says Espinas, “a
latent social tendency, always ready to show itself when
not combated by any other tendency.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Higher still, we find assemblages of variable duration,
but voluntarily formed and maintained, in view of a
common aim. They have all the characteristics of a
society—community of effort, synergy, reciprocity of services.
Darwin<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c010'><sup>[173]</sup></a> has given many examples of this: Pelicans fish in
concert, and close in round their prey like a living net;
wolves and wild dogs hunt in packs, and help each other
to attack their victims. These communities are to some
extent accidental and unstable, and may come to an end in
a final competition for the sharing of the spoil. Much
more stable are those which have the common defence for
their aim: rabbits warn one another of danger; many
mammals and birds place sentinels (it is well known how
difficult it is to approach a herd or drove of animals);
monkeys remove vermin or take out thorns from one
another’s skins, form a chain to cross the gap between two
trees, unite their forces to raise a heavy stone, and finally,
gathered into bands under the direction of a leader, they
defend themselves energetically and risk their lives to save
their companions. We might enumerate endless facts of
this kind. No doubt, we have not yet found the permanent
organisation, the fixed division of labour, the continuity,
which are peculiar to the higher animal societies; but the
instability and intermittence of these social forms help us
to understand why they exist and whence they originate.</p>

<p class='c017'>Social tendencies are derived from sympathy; they arise
in determinate conditions. The facts already given supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the answer to the questions: how do they arise? what is
their source? They arise from the nature of things, from
the conditions of the animal’s existence; they are not based
on pleasure, but on the unconscious affirmation of the will
to live; they are auxiliary to the instinct of conservation.
Society, as Spencer justly remarks, is founded on its own
desire—<i>i.e.</i>, on an instinct.</p>

<p class='c017'>The gregarious life, as this writer has shown in detail,
predominates among the herbivora and graminivora, who,
as a rule, being ill armed for strife and finding food in
abundance, find it to their advantage to live in herds.</p>

<p class='c017'>The contrary is the case with the carnivora; they are
well armed, and need ample space in which to hunt down
their prey, so that it is to their advantage to live in isolation,
except in those cases already mentioned, where they
associate together for a difficult chase, or for defence
against a dangerous enemy.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c010'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>We may add that there are animals which, as they find
it to their advantage or otherwise, live alternately in communities
or isolated. “Certain sociable birds in Australia
build bowers of branches, where they assemble in great
numbers during the day. In pairing-time the society is
broken up, and each couple retires by itself to construct its
own separate nest. While the temporary families last there
is no longer any assemblage, nor any life in common; it
only begins again when the young are able to try their wings.
This is only one of numberless examples which might be
mentioned.”<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c010'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>In short, gregarious life depends on stature, strength,
means of defence, kind and distribution of food, and mode
of propagation. Derived from necessity, this habit of life
in common creates a solidarity which is not mechanical and
external, but psychological: the sight, the touch, the smell
of his companions constitute in each individual a part of
his own consciousness, of which he feels the want in its
absence; the distressed state and the lamentations of an
animal separated by chance from the herd are well known.</p>

<p class='c017'>Here a disputed question suggests itself. It has been
already settled by implication in the course of the statements
already made, but it cannot be thus treated retrospectively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>and merely in passing. For the moment I may
confine myself to indicating it. If we compare family
societies and gregarious societies, what relation is there
between them? We find ourselves in presence of two
opinions or theories—one in favour of unity, the other
of duality.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first, the most ancient and widespread, derives
social life from domestic life. The family is the social
molecule: by its increase are formed aggregates of a more
or less complex character, whose life in common creates a
solidarity and an exchange of services—<i>i.e.</i>, the conditions
of a community.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second admits two groups of irreducible feelings and
tendencies, mutually independent, though there are points
of contact. The social instinct is not derived from the
domestic feelings, while the latter are not derived from the
social feelings. They are distinct by nature, having their
respective sources in the attraction of like for like, irrespective
of sex, and in the sexual appetite and the development
of the tender emotions.</p>

<p class='c017'>More than this: some writers, especially zoologists, have
maintained that there is not merely dualism but <em>antagonism</em>.
When the feelings of domestic life are strong, social solidarity
is lax or non-existent. When social solidarity is
close and rigorous, the family tendencies are transitory,
effaced, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span>—<i>e.g.</i>, in ants and bees. The case of the
Australian birds shows us this antagonism in an alternating
form, the domestic and the social tendency predominating
by turns. No doubt this antagonism is not irremediable
and is compatible with various modifications and compromises;
but there is, in fact, a dualism not to be explained
away. I shall return later on to this question, only remarking
in anticipation that the dualist view seems to me the
only admissible one.</p>

<p class='c017'>IV. The higher societies are those in which the animal
world has attained its loftiest degree of social development.
In them we find division of labour, solidarity, stability, and
continuity through several generations. Such are bees,
wasps, ants, termites, beavers, etc. It is not part of our
subject to study them, since our only aim is to follow the
social tendencies to their highest point; but the problem
already suggested again arises: On what foundation do these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>higher societies rest? Espinas, who admits the view of the
family as the source of social life, classes them among
societies having reproduction for their purpose. For my
own part, I refer them to the gregarious state, in which
they mark the stage of the highest perfection. Let me
take this opportunity of pointing out the inconveniences of
a false position and the factitious difficulties arising from
it. The author draws out (pp. 370 <i>et seq.</i>) a detailed comparison
between the societies of bees and those of ants; he
demonstrates the superiority of the latter, who, according to
circumstances, dig, carve, build, hunt, store up food, reap
harvests, keep slaves and cattle, and when they carry on
war against the wasps (the warlike representatives of the
bees) gain the victory. He also clearly shows that this
superiority is due to their terrestrial habits, in which every
contact, every march, leaves them a precise indication of the
nature of their surroundings. But he finds something perplexing
in this superiority. As a matter of fact, a hive is
a perfect domestic society, since the queen-bee—<i>i.e.</i>, the
common mother—is the visible soul of social life among the
bees. An ant-heap is imperfect, “inferior” as a domestic
society, as containing several females. The apparent contradiction
disappears, if we consider that in both cases,
especially in the second, the essential element is the
solidarity among the members, the mutual attraction between
similar beings, and that, consequently, we must refer them to
the gregarious, and not to the domestic type. For the rest,
in neither case does the family, in the true sense of the
word, exist: it is needless to demonstrate this at length, it
is quite sufficient to note the absence of maternal love.
And so certain writers have made use of this argument—as
I have already said—to prove that such a high development
of the social tendencies has only been possible through
the suppression of the family tendencies.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>If we pass from animals to man, the situation remains the
same, and the tendency to social life, in spite of its manifold
adaptations, does not change its nature; it is always at bottom
a solidarity and a reciprocity of services, determined by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>conditions of human existence and variable as they. We
need not come back to this; but the question already
hinted at—that of the relation between the emotional manifestations
serving as a basis to the family on the one
hand, and those which are the foundation of social life on
the other hand—presents itself anew. We cannot evade it,
if we desire any light on the origin of the social feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we assume the family as the primitive fact which, by its
increase, produced the clan, and afterwards, more complex
aggregates, such as tribes, connected with each other by the
memory of a common ancestor and at last subject to the
authority of a patriarch-king, the social development is
simply an expansion of the natural family. On this hypothesis,
the domestic tendencies (founded on reproduction)
are primary; the social tendencies are derivative and of
secondary or tertiary formation.</p>

<p class='c017'>If, on the contrary, we consider the smallest social groups
(hordes, clans, or whatever other name they may be called
by) as existing by themselves, independently of the domestic
group, the tendency to live in societies must be considered
as irreducible and self-determined; there is only one more
general emotional phenomenon whence it could be derived,
viz., sympathy.</p>

<p class='c017'>Evidently, this question cannot be settled <i>a priori</i>, but
only by the interpretation of facts. Now there is no lack
of documents, supplied by ethnology from observations on
actually existing primitive peoples, by the history of the
remotest epochs, and by the literary monuments of the
earliest ages, which are the echo of prehistoric times.
There is no lack, either, of authorised works on the subject:
MacLennan, Bachofen, Tylor, Sumner Maine, Starcke,
Westermarck—to cite only a few at random. Although
there is much disagreement, both as to the facts and the
interpretation of the facts, the probability is very slight in
favour of the priority of the family, very great in favour of two
distinct developments with inevitable points of contact and
interference.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us briefly recall the most generally admitted results
of research into the evolution of the family and the progress
of social development.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The evolution of the family has certainly not proceeded
in all places in the same way, a circumstance which always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>permits the critic to oppose facts to the view he is combating.
A disease inherent in the human mind induces
most writers to try and refer everything to <em>one</em> formula,
to impose on facts that perfect unity which, in such matters,
does not appear very probable. Those who assign the
greatest length of time to the evolution of the family admit
three stages: promiscuity, matriarchate, patriarchate.</p>

<p class='c017'>The period of primitive promiscuity (Bachofen, MacLennan,
Girard-Teulon, etc.) is contested and rejected by
many authorities. In any case, it does not seem as if we
could establish the rule without a great number of exceptions.
Not to speak, however, of archaic institutions
which have been interpreted in this sense, and as survivals,
there are still certain Tartar populations which approach
this stage. At Hawaii, the individual was related to the
whole horde, age alone determining the relationships: every
one called all the old people indiscriminately grandfather
and grandmother; all those who, as far as age went, might
be his parents, father and mother; all those of his own
generation, brothers and sisters; and so on for sons and
daughters, grandsons and grand-daughters. These five
terms expressed all known degrees of kinship. We may
note, in passing, that a very weak psychological argument
has been put forward in order to disprove the existence of
this period—viz., that the natural jealousy of man would
have rendered promiscuity impossible, at least for any
length of time. Those who have hazarded such reasoning
have been too ready to judge primitive man by civilised
standards. However this may be, such a mass, without
individual relationships, is rather a society than a family; or
rather, it is an undifferentiated state, which might be compared
to the lowest form of animal societies (the nutritive),
which also is undifferentiated.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the period of the matriarchate, which appears to have
lasted for a considerable time, the mother is the centre of
the family. This domestic form, coexisting with polygamy,
polyandry, and even with monogamy, has left so many
traces, and is still met with in so many different races and
countries, from the ancient Egyptians and Etruscans to the
present natives of Sumatra and some regions of Africa, that
there is no dispute on the subject. The woman gives her
name to the children, kinship is reckoned, and the inheritance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>of property (though not always that of political
dignities) descends, in the female line; the position of most
importance is filled, not by the father, but the uncle—the
mother’s brother. The causes of the matriarchal system
have been much discussed. Did it originate in an assumption
that the true father was unknown, or in a common
opinion of his insignificance? Whatever view may be
adopted, it seems to me reasonable to compare the matriarchate
with the predominating system among animals—<i>i.e.</i>,
maternal societies where the male is not admitted.</p>

<p class='c017'>The patriarchate (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>agnatio</i></span>) which makes the father the
centre of the family brings us down to the historic epoch,
to which it was even anterior in some parts of the globe.
Its appearance is saluted in lyrical terms by Bachofen as
the triumph of ideas over matter: “By the spiritual principle
of paternity the chains of tellurism were broken;” it was a
conquest of mind over material nature—over what can be
seen and touched.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c010'><sup>[176]</sup></a> It is not known how it came about,
whether by adoption or by a pretence of childbirth. In any
case, it corresponds with the admission of the male into
animal societies.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The development of social life is quite otherwise. It
would be foreign to our purpose to retrace its successive
phases; let us confine ourselves to the question of origin.
What was primitive man? On this point much has been
written by way of argument and conjecture. H. Spencer,
in his <cite>Sociology</cite> (vol. i.), has made a complete restoration
from prehistoric documents, burial-mounds, and more
especially from the condition of contemporary savages.
Nothing proves that this picture will suit all classes; there
have existed not one primitive man, but primitive men
differing considerably, according to race and environment.</p>

<p class='c017'>However far we go back, the first form of life in common
seems to be the horde, an unstable, unorganised aggregate,
without recognised kinships, drawn together instinctively in
view of utility and defence. But the true social unit, which
arose at an early period in various parts of the globe, is the
clan (and analogous institutions), a fixed, stable, coherent,
closed aggregate, founded on religious or other affiliation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>(but not on descent), independent of family conditions: a
man cannot belong to two clans at once, and in most cases
each of these groups is in a hostile attitude towards the
rest. How has this social molecule been able to aggregate
to itself others, and this closed organism to break its
narrow limits, in order to extend itself by increase and
fusion? This is a somewhat obscure question; perhaps by
exogamy, <i>i.e.</i>, the imperative custom which forbade marriage
within the group (yet in other groups the rule was endogamy,
<i>i.e.</i>, the prohibition of marriage outside them); more probably
the great agent of assimilation and fusion was war,
followed by the assimilation of the conquered.</p>

<p class='c017'>This simple comparison shows that the family and the
clan are not similar institutions: the first is an autonomous
group belonging to a master, and having for its end the
enjoyment of property; the second is a group of another
nature having for its end the common struggle for
existence. “Where the interests defended by the family
are less important than those of the clan, the family is
influenced by the ideas which regulate the clan organisation;
and this fact repeats itself in all primitive societies
when defence against an outside enemy is the dominant
necessity.”<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c010'><sup>[177]</sup></a> The family group and the social group have
each sprung from different tendencies, from distinct needs;
each has its special, independent psychological origin, and
there is no possible derivation from one to the other.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Life in common, even under the gregarious form, requires
certain ways of acting, and habits founded on sympathy and
determined by the concerted aim pursued by all. In
order that it may become stable and constitute a society,
an element of fixity must be added—the more or less clear
consciousness of an obligation, of a rule, of what has to be
done or avoided. This is the appearance of the <em>moral
sentiment</em>. All conceptions of morality, coarse or refined,
theoretical or purely practical, agree on this point; divergences
exist, in practice, only as to the characteristics of the
act reputed obligatory; in theory, only as to its origin.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>All <em>real</em> morality which has lived, <i>i.e.</i> governed a human
society, large or small, which has existed, not in the
academic abstractions of moralists, but in the concrete
development of history, and has run its complete course,
passes through two principal periods.</p>

<p class='c017'>One of these is instinctive, spontaneous, unconscious,
unreflecting, determined by the conditions of existence of
a given group at a given moment. It expresses itself in
custom—a heterogeneous mixture of beliefs and actions
which, from the point of view of reason and of a more
advanced culture, we consider sometimes as moral, sometimes
as immoral, sometimes as unmoral, <i>i.e.</i>, puerile and
futile, but all of which have been rigorously observed.</p>

<p class='c017'>The other is conscious, reflecting, many-sided, complex,
like the higher forms of social and moral life. It expresses
itself in institutions, written laws, religious or civil codes;
and still more in the abstract speculations of philosophical
moralists. Then, the apogee being reached, vague aspirations
reach out towards a new, dimly apprehended ideal,
and the cycle begins over again.</p>

<p class='c017'>Most constructors of a scientific system of morality have
forgotten or neglected the first period; but wrongly so, for
it is the source of the second. This, too, is the reason for
the two opposite views held with regard to the origin of
moral development.</p>

<p class='c017'>Some seek it in the order of knowledge, whence they
deduce all the rest; they suppose innate ideas, or an
adaptation acquired through a long process and fixed by
heredity (Spencer), or the consciousness of a categorical
imperative, or the notion of utility; all of which are intellectual
solutions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Others seek it in the order of instinct and feeling. They
admit tendencies, impulses implanted in us by nature, <i>i.e.</i>,
forming part of our organisation, like thirst and hunger,
whose satisfaction produces pleasure and their non-satisfaction
pain; this is the emotional view.</p>

<p class='c017'>The two are not absolutely irreconcilable: each of them
corresponds to a different period of evolution; the emotional
view to the instinctive stage, the stage of moral chaos; the intellectualist
view to the reflective stage of rational organisation;
but it is clear that one alone can claim the mark of its
origin. In other words, we may say: in the moral consciousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>there are two elements—judgment and feeling.
A judgment (approving or condemnatory) on our own conduct
and that of others is the result of a deeper process—not
an intellectual one—of an emotional process of which
it is only the clear and intelligible manifestation in
consciousness. It would be a psychological absurdity
to suppose that a bare, dry idea, an abstract conception
without emotional accompaniments, and resembling a
geometrical notion, could have the least influence on human
conduct. No doubt, we must admit that the evolution
is rather that of moral ideas than of the moral sentiment,
which, in itself, is no more than a tendency to act—a predisposition;
but an evolution of <em>purely speculative</em> ideas,
with no emotional accompaniment, will have no results
in the practical order. We may note that the opposition
between these two views is constantly reflected in
the history of moral theory. In England, where psychology
predominates, the doctrine of feeling has had numerous
champions, from Shaftesbury down to the present day.
In Germany, where metaphysics are predominant, the
intellectualist doctrine, since Kant, occupies the first place,
except with Schopenhauer and his adherents. It is quite
natural that the metaphysicians, intellectualists by temperament
and by profession, should have adopted this
position.</p>

<p class='c017'>For the rest we are concerned here with the moral sentiment,
and with that alone; the other elements of morality do
not form part of our study. It consists, at bottom, in
movement or arrest of movement, in a tendency to act or
not to act; it is not, <em>in its origin</em>, due to an idea or a
judgment; it is instinctive, and herein lies its strength. It
is innate, not like an alleged archetype, infused into man,
invariable, illuminating him everywhere and always, but in
the same way as hunger and thirst and other constitutional
needs. It is necessary; it forces one to act (when not kept
in check by counter-tendencies), as the sight of water forces
the duckling to plunge into it. Thus we must say that the
man who impulsively throws himself into danger to save
another is more thoroughly moral than he who only does
so after reflection; one must be blinded by intellectualist
prejudices to maintain the contrary. <em>Natural</em> morality is
a gift—theologians would say a grace; it is artificial,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>acquired morality, which is measured by the quantity of
resistance overcome. Finally, like every other tendency,
it results in satisfaction or dissatisfaction (<i>e.g.</i>, remorse).<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c010'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
In short, its innateness and its necessity place it in the <em>motor</em>,
not in the intellectual order.</p>

<p class='c017'>These characteristics being determined, let us follow the
progress of its evolution. It presents two aspects: first, the
positive, corresponding to the genesis of the beneficent
feelings, or active altruism, an internal evolution—<i>i.e.</i>, one
of the primary feeling, in and through itself; secondly,
negative, corresponding to the rise of the sense of justice,
an external evolution—<i>i.e.</i>, one produced under the pressure
of conditions of existence and coercive means.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. We include under the name of beneficence, or active
altruism, such feelings as benevolence, generosity, devotion,
charity, pity, etc.; in short, those foreign or contrary to
the instinct of individual self-preservation. Their fundamental
conditions are two psychological facts already
studied:</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Sympathy, in the etymological sense, <i>i.e.</i>, an emotional
unison, the possibility of feeling with another, and like him.
Could a society be based on this state alone? In extreme
cases this might happen; but such a society would be
transitory, precarious, unstable: we have found similar
examples in the gregarious state, animal or human.
Stability requires stronger ties, that is to say, moral
ones.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The altruistic tendency, or tender emotion, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>exists in all men, except in those to be referred to at
the end of this chapter. It belongs to our constitution,
as much as the fact of having two eyes or a stomach.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now the question put to us is this: How is active
altruism developed, and by what psychological mechanism?
How do disinterested feelings arise from primitive egoism?
Setting aside all metaphysical solutions, such as Schopenhauer’s
theory of universal pity, compassion (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Mitleid</i></span>) for all
beings, founded on a vague consciousness of community
of being and identity of origin—a monistic conception,—I
shall confine myself to a strictly psychological explanation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Benevolence arises from a particular form of activity
accompanied by pleasure: this vague and obscure formula
will be explained presently.</p>

<p class='c017'>The fundamental tendency consists, in the first place, of
preserving, and then of extending one’s self, of being and
well-being, <i>i.e.</i>, expending activity. Man may devote this
activity to things: he cuts, hacks, destroys, overthrows,—these
are destructive activities; he sows, plants, builds, and
exercises preservative or creative activities. He may apply
it to animals or to men; he injures, maltreats, destroys, or
he cares for, helps, saves. Destructive activity is accompanied
by pleasure, but by a pathological one, since it is
the cause of evil. Preservative or creative activity is
accompanied by pure pleasure, leaving behind it no painful
feeling; consequently, it tends to repeat and increase itself:
the object or the person which is the cause of pleasure
becomes a centre of attraction, the starting-point of an
agreeable association. To sum up, we have (1) a tendency
to the display of our creative activity; (2) the pleasure of
succeeding; (3) an object or living being to play a receptive
part; (4) an association between this being or object and
the pleasure experienced; whence a continually increasing
attraction towards this being or object. The conservative
tendency in action and the law of transference (see Part
I., Chap. <a href='#ch1.12'>XII</a>.) are the essential agents in the rise of
altruism.</p>

<p class='c017'>This may be justified by several examples. If we reflect
on the preceding, it will be understood that benevolence
may well be the result of chance, and have, in its origin, no intentional
character. A man, without paying any special heed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>to it, happens to throw some water on a plant which was
drying up beside his door; next day he chances to notice
that it is beginning to revive; he repeats the operation,
intentionally; he becomes more and more interested in
the plant, grows attached to it, and would not like to be
deprived of it.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c010'><sup>[179]</sup></a> This is a very trivial, everyday occurrence,
and there is no one who has not experienced something of
the sort; this is all the better, as showing us the rise of the
feeling in all its simplicity. If this happens in the case of
a plant, how much more easily in that of an intelligent
animal or a man!</p>

<p class='c017'>It is an observed fact that a man attaches himself to
another rather in proportion to the services he renders
than to those he receives from him. There is, in general,
a stronger current of benevolence passing from the
benefactor to his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>protégé</i></span> than <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>. Common
opinion considers this illogical: from the point of view
of reason, it is so—not from that of feeling; and the
preceding analysis even shows that it <em>must be</em> so, because
the benefactor has put more of himself into the recipient
of his bounty than the latter can do to him. Thus,
in many persons, gratitude needs to be supported by
reflection.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we are ill-disposed towards any one, the best and
surest remedy against this incipient aversion is to render
him some service. Conversely, the person who refuses all
our benefits and obstinately avoids them becomes an object
of indifference, or even hatred.</p>

<p class='c017'>“During the proscriptions of Marius and Sulla,” says
Friedmann, “there were many sons who, out of fear,
gave up their father, but it was never known that a
father had denounced his son; a fact that somewhat
startled the Roman moralists, who were unable to explain
it.” The explanation is involved in the constitution
of the Roman family, by which the father could confer
many benefits on the son, whereas the son was entirely
dependent on the father, and could do nothing for
him.</p>

<p class='c017'>Many other incidents might be cited to justify the
accuracy of the preceding analysis. Such is the mechanism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>by means of which our emotional self succeeds in externalising,
in alienating itself; but this could not be done were
there not at the origin and starting-point a primary tendency,
already studied under the name of tender emotion. It is
clear, also, that beneficence is a generic term designating
forms which vary according to circumstances: charity,
generosity, devotion, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>The extension and heightening of the feeling of beneficence
have taken place slowly, and owing to the work of certain
men who deserve to be called <em>discoverers</em> in morals. This expression
may sound strangely in some ears, because they
are imbued with the theory of an innate and universal
knowledge of good and evil imparted to all men at all
times. If we admit, on the contrary,—as observation
teaches us to do,—not a ready-made, but a growing
morality, it must necessarily be the discovery of an individual
or group of individuals. Every one admits the
existence of inventors in geometry, in music, in the plastic
and mechanical arts; but there have also been men in
moral disposition far superior to their contemporaries, who
have initiated or promoted reform in this department.
Let us note (for this point is of the highest importance)
that the <em>theoretic</em> conception of a higher moral
ideal, of a step in advance, is not sufficient; it needs
a powerful emotion leading to action, and, by contagion,
communicating its own impulse to others. The onward
march is proportioned to what is <em>felt</em>, not to what is
understood.</p>

<p class='c017'>Were the human race, in the beginning, cannibals?
Some affirm this, others deny it. What is certain is that
the custom of eating one’s fellow-men has existed in many
places, and still exists in some. It has been explained by
scarcity of food, by superstitious beliefs, by the intoxication
of triumph in annihilating a vanquished enemy, by the idea
of assimilating his strength and courage, and by a variety
of other reasons; but it has not been sufficiently remarked
that its extinction has not always been due to the intervention
of superior races. It has sometimes taken place
on the spot. In the Tahiti Islands it had disappeared
shortly before the arrival of Bougainville; among the Redskins,
and even among the Fijians, parties had been formed
in order to suppress not only cannibalism, but the tortures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>inflicted on prisoners of war.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c010'><sup>[180]</sup></a> The promoters of this
abolition, whether individuals or groups, were certainly
inventors. The universality of human sacrifices is well
known; they are found still existing during the historic
period, from China to Judæa, from Greece to Gaul, from
Carthage to Rome. How did they disappear? On this
point we have nothing but ignorance or legends, but they
could not have disappeared without the agency of man.
Du Chaillu cites a case in which reform is, so to speak,
caught in the act—that of an African chief who was the
first to give orders that no slave should be killed at his
tomb.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c010'><sup>[181]</sup></a> Among the Aztecs, with their bloodthirsty religion,
a sect, formed before the arrival of the Spaniards, had placed
itself under the protection of a deity who abhorred bloodshed.
All the great ancient legislators, whether historical
or legendary—Manes, Confucius, Moses, Buddha,—we might
say all founders of religions, have been discoverers in
morals; whether the discovery originated with themselves
alone or with a collectivity as whose summary and embodiment
they may be regarded, matters little.</p>

<p class='c017'>It would be easy to continue this historical demonstration,
but the above is sufficient to justify the term discoverers.
From causes of which we are ignorant, but
analogous to those which produce great poets or painters,
there arise men of indisputable moral superiority who <em>feel</em>
what others do not feel, just as a great poet does compared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>with ordinary men. And for one who has succeeded,
how many have failed for want of a favourable
environment! A St. Vincent de Paul among the Kanakas
would be as impossible as a Mozart among the Fuegians.</p>

<p class='c017'>In primitive societies there has been a long struggle
between the strongest egoistic tendencies, with their dissolvent
action, and the weaker and intermittent altruistic
tendencies, which have progressed through the agency of
some more enlightened individuals, and also with the help
of force, of which we still have to speak.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. Let us now examine the development of the moral
sentiment under its negative and restrictive aspect—<i>i.e.</i>, as
the sense of justice. Here the intellectual element evidently
preponderates, and its evolution involves the other.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Justice,” says Littré, “has the same foundation as
science.” One rests on the principle of identity which
governs the region of speculation, the other rests on the
principle of equivalence and rules the sphere of action.
Justice, in its origin, is a compensation for damages. Its
evolution starts from an instinctive semi-conscious manifestation,
rising by progressive steps to a universalist conception.
Let us mark the principal stages.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first, and lowest, is neither moral nor social, but
purely animal and reflex—"a defensive reflex."<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c010'><sup>[182]</sup></a> The individual
who suffers violence, who thinks himself attacked or
injured, immediately reacts. This is “the exasperated
instinct of conservation,” or, to call it by its true name,
revenge. So the savage who, before Darwin’s eyes, broke
his son’s head for having dropped a store of shell-fish, the
fruit of a laborious day’s fishing. This defensive reflex
frequently recurs in the psychology of crowds; it is needless
to give instances. It may seem paradoxical to take revenge
as a starting-point for the sense of justice; but we shall see
how it becomes mitigated and rationalised.</p>

<p class='c017'>In fact, a second stage corresponds to revenge deferred
through premeditation, reflection, or some analogous cause.
It tends towards equivalence and reaches it under the form
of retaliation, so frequent in primitive communities. The
idea of equality, tooth for tooth, eye for eye, has won its
way; the instinct has become intellectualised.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>So far, the compensation claimed would appear to have
only an individual character; but it must very early have
taken on a collective character, by reason of the close
solidarity uniting the members of the small social aggregate—the
clan or family. An all-powerful opinion forces the
injured party to pursue his revenge even when he does not
wish it; and when a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>vendetta</i></span> is in force as between clan and
clan, the stage of collective responsibility appears, and the
notion of the compensation due is enlarged.</p>

<p class='c017'>However, revenge restores, in the social aggregate, a state
of war, which has to be eliminated; hence a reaction on the
part of the community tending to suppress or attenuate it.
This is the stage of arbitration and peace-making. Many
facts show that, in the beginning, the decision of the
umpires is without binding value, and supported by no
coercive means. It is a proof not so much of culpability
as of an indemnity to be paid to those concerned; the
criminal trial is as yet a civil action.</p>

<p class='c017'>For this temporary and unsanctioned arbitration the
social development logically substitutes a permanent and
guaranteed arbitration, exercised by a chief, or an aristocracy,
or the popular assembly. Compensation becomes
obligatory and is forcibly imposed. The condemned person
must submit or leave the community; if refractory, he is
excommunicated, and in primitive societies the outlaw’s
life is intolerable; we see the equivalent of it in modern
strikes. Let us also note the somewhat widely distributed
custom of a division of the indemnity imposed, one portion
being assigned to the injured party, the other to the state—<i>i.e.</i>,
the chief. The notion of justice has taken on a
definitely social character.</p>

<p class='c017'>It only remains that it should become universal. It long
remains enclosed within the limits of the social group. All
that contributes to the material and moral welfare of the group
is good, and conversely; outside the group, all acts are
<em>unmoral</em>. We find in history, and even at the present time,
many proofs of this dualism or duplication of the individual,
according as he is acting within his own social environment
or with regard to strangers. Such were the Germans of
Cæsar’s time.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c010'><sup>[183]</sup></a> In their earlier period, the Greeks considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>themselves as less under moral obligation towards
the Barbarians, and the Romans towards foreigners (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>hostes</i></span>).
It is especially owing to the efforts of the philosophers—Socrates,
Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics—that justice ceased
to be national and became universal. It might be
added that at that period when the notion of justice remains
a national one, it still varies within the group, according
to caste; it is not the same for priests and warriors, for
free men and for slaves, for aristocrats and for merchants.
In the beginning, particularism was the rule.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is evident that, on the negative side, the evolution of
moral life has been especially due to the progress of intelligence;
the emotional element has only been incidental.
Compared with the sense of justice, the feeling of active
benevolence, if not evolved more quickly, at least appeared
sooner, because nearer to instinct and less dependent
on reason. A certain philosopher (Kant, I believe) was
surprised that there is so much kindness and so little justice
among men. He did not observe as a psychologist, or else
he was led astray by intellectualist prejudice. This must be
so, because tenderness is innate and spontaneous, justice
acquired and deliberate; because one springs directly from
an instinct, while the other has to undergo various metamorphoses.
If man is sociable and moral, it is less because
he thinks than because he feels in a certain manner and
tends in a certain direction.</p>

<p class='c017'>To conclude: moral emotion is a very complex state.
Those sentimentalists in the last century, or in this, who
have maintained the hypothesis of a “moral sense,” have
erroneously considered it as a special sense with an innate
faculty of discriminating good and evil. It is not a simple
act, but the sum of a set of tendencies. Let us eliminate
the intellectual elements, and enumerate its emotional constituents
only: (1) as basis, sympathy—<i>i.e.</i>, a community of
nature and disposition; (2) the altruistic or benevolent
tendency manifesting itself under different forms (attraction
of like to like, maternal or paternal affection, etc.), at first
weak, but gaining more expansion by the restriction of the
egoistic feelings; (3) the sense of justice with its obligatory
character—whose origin we have just traced; (4) the desire
of approbation or of divine or human rewards, and the
fear of disapprobation and punishments. As in the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>of all complex feelings, its composition must vary with the
predominance of one or other of its constituent elements;
in one case it is obligation (the Stoics), in another charity,
in many the fear of public opinion or of the law, of God
or of the devil. It is impossible that it should be constant
and identical in all men.</p>

<p class='c017'>IV.</p>

<p class='c017'>The pathology of the moral sense cannot detain us long,
its detailed study belonging to the department of criminal
anthropology. Numerous works have been published on
this subject within the last half-century; there would be no
advantage in presenting a bald abstract of these. Lombroso’s
view of the “born criminal,” with his physiological, psychical,
and social characteristics, has been violently attacked, and
sustained serious damage. Several successive theories have
attempted to explain the existence of this moral anomaly:
atavism, according to which the born criminal is a survival,
a return to primitive man, who is assumed to have been
violent and unsociable; infantilism, which has recourse, not
to heredity, but to arrested development, and alleges that the
perversion which is permanent in the criminal is normal,
but transient, in the child; the pathological view which
connects the criminal type with epilepsy, considered as
the prototype of violent and destructive impulses; the
sociological view (the most recent), which attributes a
preponderant function to social conditions, and maintains
that the criminal is “a microbe inseparable from his environment.”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c010'><sup>[184]</sup></a>
We need not enter into a detailed examination of
these hypotheses, which have given rise to much passionate
debate: one question alone concerns our subject, that of
moral insensibility—a condition described, long before the
days of criminal anthropology, under the names of <em>moral
insanity</em> (Prichard, 1835), <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>folie morale</i></span>, impulsive insanity, instinctive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>monomania, etc., and which will serve to show once
more the independence and the preponderance of feeling in
the moral life.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c010'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>“Moral insanity is a form of mental derangement in
which the intellectual faculties appear to have sustained
little or no injury, while the disorder is manifested
principally or alone in the state of the feelings, temper,
or habit.” Such is the formula of Prichard, which
has been but little modified since. Translated into the
language of pure psychology, it signifies: a complete
absence or perversion of the altruistic feelings, insensibility
to the representation of the happiness or suffering
of others, absolute egoism, with all its consequences. By
a self-evident analogy, this state has been called one
of moral blindness; and, like physical blindness, it has
various degrees. It has also been compared to idiocy.
Reduced to the vegetative and sensitive life, the idiot
is, intellectually, opposed to the genius, while the moral
idiot is the antithesis of the great benefactors of humanity
(Schüle).</p>

<p class='c017'>We may find numerous instances of moral insanity in
works on mental pathology and criminal anthropology.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c010'><sup>[186]</sup></a> It
shows itself in two forms: (1) the passive, or apathetic—<i>i.e.</i>,
that of pure insensibility; if the temperament is cold and
the circumstances favourable, there is no violence to be
feared; (2) the active, or impulsive, where there is no check
on the violence of the appetites. Taken as a whole, it consists
in: complete insensibility, absence of pity, cold ferocity,
absence of remorse after committing acts of violence, or
even murder. On this last point statistics and figures have
been given whose precision makes me somewhat suspicious;<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c010'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>for it is very difficult to penetrate so far into the consciousness
of a criminal as to be duped neither by the
hypocrisy which simulates remorse, nor by the boastfulness
which feels but will not acknowledge it. The
absence of all maternal feeling, though rare, has also been
observed.</p>

<p class='c017'>Moral insensibility is usually innate, and coincident
with other symptoms of degeneracy. Among several
children of the same family, brought up in the same
surroundings, having received the same care, a single
one may differ from all the rest, be amenable neither
to gentleness nor to force, and manifest a precocious
depravity, which will only strengthen as he grows
older.</p>

<p class='c017'>This state may be acquired and momentary, its causes
being epilepsy, hysteria, apoplexy, paralytic dementia, senile
decay, blows on the head, etc. Krafft-Ebing, besides an
observation made by himself (<i>loc. cit.</i>), quotes from Wigan
the case of a young man who, in consequence of being
struck on the head with a ruler, developed complete
moral insensibility. When, by means of the operation
of trephining, a splinter of bone pressing on the brain
had been removed, he returned to his former state. We
have met with other analogous cases in the course of
this work.</p>

<p class='c017'>The most difficult and fiercely debated point is whether
this moral anomaly is strictly instinctive and emotional in
its origin, intellectual activity being entirely unconnected
with it. Most writers take the affirmative view of
this question, others deny it. The different modes of
mental activity are so interdependent, and their relations
so close, that it is difficult to solve the question definitely.
We cannot refuse to admit that the intellect sometimes
suffers from a counter-shock; but observation shows that
most of these persons are well acquainted with the requirements
of morality, and have had the abstract ideas of good,
of evil, and of duty instilled into them by education, though
without the slightest influence on their conduct. They
have moral <cite>ideas</cite>, not moral feelings—<i>i.e.</i>, a disposition to
feel and act. The law is to them nothing but a police
regulation, which they are conscious of having broken.
Their intellect, often firm and clear, is only an instrument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>for weaving skilful plots, or justifying themselves by subtle
sophisms.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was worth our while to recall, if only in a cursory
manner, the nature of moral insensibility, in order to show
the importance of the emotional element. In these cases
there is a lack of completeness, and the deficit comes, not
from the intellect, but from the character.</p>

  <h3 id='ch2.9' class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /> THE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Importance of the subject—Its Divisions. First Period:
origin of the religious feeling—Primitive notions of the
Infinite (Max Müller); Ancestor-worship (H. Spencer)—Fetichism,
animism; Predominance of fear—Practical,
utilitarian, social, but not moral character—Second
period: (1) Intellectual evolution; Conception of a
Cosmic Order first physical, then moral—Function of

<p class='c016'>It must be confessed that psychologists have not troubled
themselves greatly with the study of the religious sentiment.
Some omit it altogether, while others content themselves
with a brief reference in passing; they note the two essential
elements whence it is derived—fear, and tender emotion
(love)—without troubling themselves about the variable
relations between these two elements, or the multiform
changes undergone by them in the course of centuries,
through the annexation of other emotional states.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c010'><sup>[188]</sup></a> As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>we cannot deny its importance, this abstention, or negligence,
is not justifiable. To summon to our aid an ill-understood
respect, to maintain that one religion only
is true and all the others false, to allege that all are
alike false,—these and other analogous modes of reasoning
are not in any degree acceptable to psychology;
for, even if we take up an extreme position, and admit
that all manifestations of the religious sentiment are mere
illusion and error, it remains none the less true that
illusion and error are psychic states, and worthy of being
studied as such by psychologists. To such, the religious
sentiment is <em>a fact</em> which they have simply to analyse
and to follow through its transformations without being
competent to discuss its objective value or its legitimacy.
Thus understood, the question bears on two principal
points: primary manifestations and their evolution,
<i>i.e.</i>, the different elements which have constituted the
religious sentiment during the various stages of its
existence.</p>

<p class='c017'>In every religious belief there are of necessity two parts:
an intellectual element, a knowledge which constitutes the
object of belief, and an emotional state, a feeling which
accompanies the former and expresses itself in action. To
any one deficient in the second element, the religious
feeling is unknown, inaccessible; nothing remains to such
persons but abstract metaphysical conceptions. The study
of the religious sentiment, in its evolution, cannot dissociate
these two elements; and it is the degree in which the
element of knowledge is present which renders a precise
division possible. I trace three periods: (1) that of
perception and concrete imagination, where fear and
the practical, utilitarian tendencies are predominant;
(2) that of medium abstraction and generalisation,
characterised by the addition of moral elements; (3)
that of the highest concepts, where, the emotional
element becoming more and more rarefied, the religious
feeling tends to be confounded with the so-called intellectual
feelings.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>
  <h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c019'>As usual, authorities are not agreed on the question
of origin. Under what form did the religious sentiment
first make its appearance? We must first put aside two
extremely systematic answers, which, although differing in
spirit, have this in common, that they are both purely
intellectualist.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first, a very ancient one, has found its latest and
clearest interpreter in Max Müller, who thinks that the
notion of the Divine, more especially under the form of
the Infinite, preceded that of the gods. Our senses give
us the finite, but “beyond, behind, beneath, and within the
finite, the infinite is always present to our senses. It presses
upon us, it grows upon us from every side. What we call
finite in space and time, in form and word, is nothing but
a veil or net which we ourselves have thrown over the
infinite.”<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c010'><sup>[189]</sup></a> What, then, is the infinite, he asks, but the
object of all religions? The religion of the infinite precedes
and comprehends all others, and as the infinite is implied
by the senses (<i>i.e.</i>, the limits to our sensory perceptions
imply an unlimited region beyond), it follows that religion
can, with as much right as reason, be called a development
of our sensory perceptions. The earliest religion consisted
in the adoration of various objects, taken, each in turn, and
isolatedly, as incarnations of the notion of the Infinite.
This is what Max Müller calls “Henotheism.” For
him, polytheism and even fetichism are later developments,
resulting from the breaking up of the primitive
unity, and due to a disease of language: each name
becomes a distinct deity; words are raised to the dignity of
things, having their life, their attributes, and their legends:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nomina numina</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>This last view, though it has had a certain vogue among
linguists, is worth nothing as a psychological explanation, for
it is quite clear that the word is only a starting-point or a
vehicle for the process of thought, which is the sole agent
of the metamorphosis. If the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nomina</i></span> become <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>numina</i></span>, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>is by a disease of imagination or thought, rather than of
language.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c010'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>As for the principal thesis, the alleged primitive notion
of the Infinite, which is the source of henotheism, it is a
metaphysical hypothesis of extreme improbability. Primitive
man, enclosed within hard conditions of life, is practical and
positive rather than a dreamer; he does not naturally tend
towards the Beyond. But a better reason than this, and
an entirely psychological one, is that he is incapable of
attaining to even a medium degree of abstraction and
generalisation. How could a savage, who cannot count up
to four, form any idea whatever of the Infinite? Evidently,
this notion of the Illimitable is far beyond him.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is only one way of imparting a certain psychological
verisimilitude to Max Müller’s view, viz., to strip it of its
intellectualist character, and admit as its origin a feeling
rather than a notion, a craving, a tendency, rather than a
cognition. Of these two factors, which make up all religious
belief, one intellectual, the other emotional, which has the
priority? Did the notion produce the feeling, or the feeling
excite the notion? Such is the problem which lies at the
heart of all debates on the origin of religious manifestations.
Some place it in the region of instinct: so Renan when he
compares religion in humanity to the nest-building instinct
of the bird. Others maintain that every feeling presupposes
an object. “At first sight this latter theory seems to have
logic on its side. It is clear that, in order to love or fear
any being, one must have conceived the notion of his
existence. Yet, however indispensable it may be to assume
an intellectual operation at the beginning of religion, we
must recognise that the feelings set in motion by this
operation must have long preceded the most ancient
formulas of primitive theology.”<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c010'><sup>[191]</sup></a> For my own part, I
am inclined to accept the priority of feeling, though unable
to supply any arguments based on fact; the period of origins
being also that of conjecture.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second theory, that of Herbert Spencer, brings us
down from the notion of the Infinite to the extremely
terrestrial mental life of savages. It is well known that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>reduces all primitive religions to the cult of ancestors—to
necrolatry. The primordial fact is the conception of a
spirit, or rather, of a <em>double</em>. The savage believes that he
has a Sosia, or, in other words, a principal <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego</i></span> and
a secondary <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego</i></span>. He infers the existence of this double
from a great number of facts, to him inexplicable: his
shadow, his reflection in the water, echoes, apparitions in
dreams, fainting, trances, epilepsy, etc. The world is thus,
for him, full of wandering spirits which he tries to propitiate.
According to Spencer, fetichism and polytheism are
only aberrant forms of ancestor-worship, and he tries to
prove this by a series of arguments, through which we need
not now follow him. Imperturbable in his systematic
deduction, he even asserts that he can derive from the
same root, by far-fetched and easily-controverted arguments,
the adoration of animals, plants, and inanimate objects.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c010'><sup>[192]</sup></a>
It is indisputable that a great number of beliefs have sprung
from this root, but this conception, which is anthropomorphism
carried to its extreme, is found to be too narrow
to include all the facts. Tylor and others have criticised it
with some vivacity, and I do not think that it now claims
many adherents.</p>

<p class='c017'>These two systematic hypotheses being put on one side,
we may remind the reader how religious development <em>seems</em>
to have taken place during this primitive period; for the
march of evolution has not been everywhere and always the
same—a difficulty already pointed out with regard to the
social instinct. According to the best authorities, the most
frequent form has been the following.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first stage is that of fetichism, polydemonism, naturism—terms
which in the history of religions are not quite
synonymous, but which answer to the same psychical condition,
the adoration of some object, living or not, which is
<em>perceived</em>—<i>i.e.</i>, apprehended as a concrete form, at the same
time body and soul—or rather animated by a soul, judged
to be benevolent or malevolent, useful or injurious; for there
is scant justification for the opinion that the worshipper of
a piece of wood or stone sees in it only a purely material
object.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second stage is that of animism or spiritism, “a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>belief in spirits having no substantial bond or necessary
connection with determinate natural objects.” The spirit
is conceived as independent, separable; it goes and comes,
enters and departs; it is attributed not only to men, but
also to animals: the savage tries to deprecate the wrath of
the beast he has killed in hunting, the chief has his horses
and dogs buried with him. Psychologically, this stage
corresponds to a preponderance of the imagination over
simple perception.</p>

<p class='c017'>These primitive forms of religious belief originate in the
tendency of the savage, and the child, perhaps also of the
higher animal, to look upon everything as alive, to attribute
desires, passions, will, to everything that acts, to form his
ideas of nature from what he knows of his own nature.
This anthropomorphism results from the awakening of
reasoning thought under its baldest form: analogy, the first
source of myth, language, arts, and even science. But
those analogies, which to us are merely images, were
realities to primitive man. It is needless to insist on so
well known a point. We must remember, however, that
this primitive god-creating operation is a projection from
our activity rather than from our intelligence; it originates
with man as a <em>motor</em> rather than as a thinking being.</p>

<p class='c017'>So far we have considered nothing but the object of
belief, perceived or imagined; but what does the believer
feel? of what elements is the religious sentiment composed
during this period? We may point out the following:</p>

<p class='c017'>(1) First of all, the emotion of fear in its different
degrees, from profound terror to vague uneasiness, due to
the faith in an unknown, mysterious, impalpable Power,
able to render great services, and, more especially, to inflict
great injuries; for historians have always remarked that, in
early times, it is always malevolent and terrible genii who are
adored; the good and merciful ones are neglected; in the
following periods this state of things will be reversed.
During this period Power is the attribute of the gods.</p>

<p class='c017'>(2) A second and much less marked characteristic consists
in a certain attraction or sympathy which, though very
slight, binds the worshipper to his deity. The saying
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor”</span> is not absolutely true;
for fear has a tendency to withdrawal, flight, aversion, while
in every worship there is at least some hope of moving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>the most maleficent power and exciting its compassion,—consequently
an approach to it. Later on, this rudimentary
attraction will become the essential point.</p>

<p class='c017'>(3) A third characteristic resulting from the preceding
is that the religious feeling is strictly practical and
utilitarian; it is the direct expression of a narrow egoism.
It connects itself with the self-preserving instinct of the
individual or the group, and is in nowise, as Sergi has
maintained it to be, a pathological symptom. Quite on
the contrary, it is a weapon in the struggle for life; since it
is not a matter of indifference whether those in power
are for or against one. This by no means disinterested
character is shown in the worship which rests entirely on
the practical rule: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Do ut des</i></span>. Hence the oblations and
sacrifices proportioned to the worshippers’ desires and
requests, for which the deity owes his faithful ones an
ample recompense. Hence incantations, magic, and sorcery,
which are methods not only of alluring and appeasing the
god, but of getting possession of him by stratagem and
holding him in one’s power.</p>

<p class='c017'>(4) Lastly, from this time forward, the religious feeling
has a <em>social</em> character, or rather, the religious and social
tendencies amalgamate into a whole. It strengthens the
principle of authority, often in favour of the altruistic
tendencies, which are still very weak. The chiefs, priests,
sorcerers, speak and act in the name of a higher power,
and keep up the social tie. The worship of the dead,
which Spencer has made the mistake of generalising too
much, is an element of stability, establishing a continuity
between different generations. The community of worship
and ritual is the objective and visible expression of social
solidarity. I do not consider as belonging to this period
institutions such as the religious oath, trial by ordeal, or
others presupposing the addition of a novel element, which
is still absent. But there are other customs, local or
general—<i>e.g.</i>, that of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tabu</i></span>, existing in nearly the whole
of Oceania and elsewhere under different forms, in which
religion performs a social office, but a novel one (at least
according to our present ideas), and safeguards institutions
and conventions by terror, while still remaining outside the
region of morality.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>
  <h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c019'>Except the intellectual feelings themselves, no emotional
manifestation depends more on the intellectual development
than the religious sentiment, because every religion implies
some conception of the universe—a cosmology and a system
of metaphysics. With the first period we have scarcely passed
beyond the stage of imagination; with the second, reflection
and generalisation, whose upward progress we are about to
follow, make their appearance. The intellectual evolution
and the emotional evolution must each be studied in turn
during this second stage.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. <em>Intellectual Evolution.</em>—We shall find it useful, moreover,
to divide the study of the intellectual element into two
questions: (1) the conception of a cosmic order, at first
physical, afterwards moral; (2) the progressive march of
generalisation from an almost unlimited multiplicity up to
unity. These two processes have not always coincided or
kept pace with one another.</p>

<p class='c017'>(1) We have seen that, for primitive man, everything is
alive, full of arbitrary caprices, desires, intentions, and
especially mysteries, because everything is unforeseen: it is
the reign of universal contingency. The formula, “everything
is alive,” is, however, too absolute; it only suits those
things which were seen to move and change—<i>i.e.</i>, the
majority, not the totality of things. It seems as if the
absence of motion, stability, fixity, the want of reaction,
had been a sort of revelation to a simple mind. Perhaps
it was through the spectacle of the fixity of things that the
notion of order or law made its very humble entry into the
world. However that may be, it is certain that the depersonification
of nature began early to mark the origin of
science. In our present state of culture we find a difficulty
in representing to ourselves a state of mind in which the
idea of fixity in natural phenomena is almost <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span>; yet such
a state of mind has existed, and there is no want of documents
to prove it. The expression, “the new moon,” was
not at first a metaphor: men wondered if the sun would
always continue his course; the Mexicans anxiously awaited
his new birth every fifty years; eclipses seemed to happen
at random, and caused great terror, etc.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c010'><sup>[193]</sup></a> Gradually the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>spirit of observation and reflection arrived at constant relations,
and introduced into the conception of Nature the
ideas of order and regularity, diminishing in so far the
domain of chance and contingency. This notion of a
cosmic order has influenced religious conceptions; the
government of the physical world was attributed to the
gods; they are its regulators; each has his department
where he is supreme. The co-existence of two opposite
principles has been remarked in the religion of several
nations in this period of their development: necessity being
personified in an abstract, mysterious, inaccessible deity
(Rita among the Aryans, Ma with the Egyptians, Tao with
the Chinese, Moira or Nomos with the Greeks, etc.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c010'><sup>[194]</sup></a>); while
contingency, or rather limited arbitrary power, was personified
in more human gods having their legends, acting
within their own special sphere, as, for instance, the gods
of Greece. The latter are also sometimes divided into two
categories, which is the first step towards simplification,
one kind bestowing physical well-being—health, prosperity,
riches; the other inflicting physical ills—disease, famine,
tempest, shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c017'>The notion of the cosmic order led to that of a moral
order; the gods have first the physical government, in a
later age the ethical government of the universe. The conception
of higher powers, invested with moral attributes, has
been, as we shall afterwards see, an important stage in the
evolution of the religious sentiment. The very ancient
opinion, still prevalent among many believers, that the
crimes of men occasion epidemics, unchain the elements,
cause floods and earthquakes, shows that the human mind,
rightly or wrongly, has supposed an analogy between all the
forms of order in the universe. Hence also the change of
the physical dualism above mentioned into a moral dualism;
the genii of light and darkness become respectively moral or
immoral gods, good or bad counsellors, saviours or tempters;
and in this period a faith in the superiority and definitive
triumph of the good is firmly established. In short, the
gods have as attributes first power, then intelligence, and
lastly morality.</p>

<p class='c017'>(2) Let us now see the part played by increasing generalisation
in the constitution of religious ideas.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>When we wish to study the ascending degrees of generalisation,
not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in abstracto</i></span>, but according to facts and documents,
we may take as our guide the evolution of languages,
or, better still, the progress of the scientific spirit (as, for
instance, by following the methods of classification used in
zoology, from antiquity up to the present day); we might
also have recourse to the development of religion, for this is
the same mental process applied to a different matter. It is
sufficient to indicate the various steps in a very cursory
manner.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is a well known fact that the various races of mankind
differ greatly in their powers of abstraction and generalisation;
some can scarcely get beyond the concrete, while
others disport themselves, easily and swiftly, in the region
of the abstract. This difference of aptitude is expressed in
their religions. Many peoples have never passed beyond
polydemonism—<i>i.e.</i>, the cult of individual genii; in other
words, the realm of the concrete. Not to speak of savages,
such was the religion of the ancient Chinese empire (Tiele);
such the innumerable genii in the primitive religion of the
Romans—a people not greatly inclined to abstractions.</p>

<p class='c017'>Certain tribes have, even at the present day, words to
designate every water-course in their country, but no general
term for a river. To have found such a one is a step in
progress. It is the same in the region of religious thought:
by an analogous progress the spirit of each tree is subordinated
to the deity of the forest, the various river-spirits to a river-god,
etc. For a number of particular divinities is substituted
one specific and pre-eminent divinity.</p>

<p class='c017'>At a higher stage the mind seizes more remote resemblances
and constitutes one god for water, one for fire, one
for the earth, so that the spirits of the waters, the sky, and
the earth are severally grouped under the dominion of one
power, known in Greece as Zeus, Poseidon, or Hestia.</p>

<p class='c017'>This generalising process which has taken place with
regard to natural phenomena also goes on in the social
order. There have been, successively, gods of clans, tribes,
nations. We know how long religions—even complex and
highly organised ones—have remained merely national: the
god of a nation is its protector and guardian—watches over
it and over nothing else; but his existence does not exclude
that of other gods who are lords of other nations. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>transition to the universal, extra-national religions was
brought about by means of conquest and annexation,
but also, and more particularly, by philosophical speculation.</p>

<p class='c017'>At the point we have reached there are divine hierarchies,
analogous, on one hand, to the ideal hierarchy of individuals,
species, genera, on the other to the hierarchies of human
society: they are conceived and constituted according to
the human type. The anarchy of Vedic India is reflected
in the mythology of the Vedas, the feudality of Egypt in its
religion, Zeus resembles Agamemnon, the Peruvian Inca is
descended from the sun, and applies to his empire the
government of the solar deity; and “by an optical illusion,
human society seems to be a copy of the Divine State.”<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c010'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>In its movement towards absolute unity, the human mind
has still some stages to pass through before reaching the
term. It conceives of a divinity far superior to the rest,
who, however, act under him (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jupiter optimus maximus</span>), and
whom he does not suppress. This is “monolatry” but not
monotheism. We still find accommodations and compromises
in the conceptions of triads (trinities) and dyads (associations
of masculine and feminine divinities). In fact, pure
monotheism is a conquest of the metaphysical spirit, which
traces back the series of secondary causes to discover the
first cause, rather than an intuition of popular consciousness.</p>

<p class='c017'>This survey of ascending generalisation is somewhat
schematic, and has been presented as an ideal restoration,
though all its elements have been taken from reality. Some
nations have attained the first stages only; others have, with
much difficulty, passed beyond them; others have passed
through several at a bound. Perhaps the evolution of
religious ideas has not been in any two cases identical.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. <i>Emotional Evolution.</i>—It has been justly said that
religious feeling consists of two scales. One, in the key of
fear, is composed of painful and depressive states: terror,
fright, fear, veneration, respect, are its principal notes.
The other, in the key of tender emotion, is composed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>pleasurable and expansive states: admiration, confidence,
love, ecstasy. One expresses a feeling of dependence;
the other of attraction, going even as far as reciprocal
union.</p>

<p class='c017'>One of the first changes produced during this period of
evolution is the predominance of the second scale; in the
combination of two elementary emotions the proportional
relation has changed, whence a change in the nature of the
resultant emotion. We have seen this in the progressive
effacement of the worship of the evil gods, in the suppression
of sanguinary sacrifices, first in the case of men, then
in that of animals; in the tendency to substitute for them
simple acts of homage.</p>

<p class='c017'>A second change, and one of especial importance, consists
in the coalescence of the religious and the moral
sentiment, which contract a union so close that to many
people it seems necessary and indissoluble. We have seen
that this is not the case, and that there are religions without
morality. Primarily, the religious feeling is a special
emotional form, the moral feeling is another form. There
are, first of all, the purely naturalistic religions, afterwards
the moral religions. A mass of facts demonstrate that, in
the beginning, the religious feeling is not only quite a
stranger to morality, but even in conflict with it. We know
the bitter criticisms directed by the Greek philosophers
against the reigning religion, bearing, as it did, the impress
of myths springing from a primitive naturalism and understood
neither by orthodox believers nor by the philosophers
themselves. Contemporary criminologists have shown that
prostitutes and even ferocious criminals are most assiduous
in their devotional practices. This is because the religious
feeling, in its origin and taken by itself, is fundamentally
selfish<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c010'><sup>[196]</sup></a>, being nothing else but anxiety for one’s individual
salvation. This superposition of the moral sentiment has
taken place in all the great religions—<i>i.e.</i>, all those which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>have had a complete evolution: in Brahmanism and
especially in Buddhism when compared with the Vedic
period, in the prophets of Israel, even among the Greeks,
in the mysteries, etc. People end by believing that a right
state of mind is the best of offerings.</p>

<p class='c017'>For most religions, the supreme question is that of
human destiny. Its history, having traversed two periods,
the one naturalistic, the other moral, shows once more that
the religious and the moral sentiment are, in their origin,
two totally distinct feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'>During the first period, we find no idea of retribution
according to men’s works. The life after death is a continuation
or copy of the earthly life, sometimes resembling
it exactly, sometimes better,—most often worse. We know
the complaint of Achilles, in the <cite>Odyssey</cite> (xi), where
Homer has left us a vivid picture of this primitive belief;
men remain slaves, masters, chiefs, or kings, as they were
during life. Nay, certain tribes, projecting their aristocratic
prejudices into the other world, believed that the souls of
chiefs alone were immortal.</p>

<p class='c017'>During the second period there arises a belief in a
preliminary judgment on men’s actions, decisive of their
future destiny. The conceptions of this future life are
various: temporary or eternal penalties and rewards,
transmigration upwards or downwards, total liberation
(<em>Nirvana</em>), etc., but all resting on a moral idea. This
notion appears at an early age among the Egyptians,
in the judgment of Osiris and the weighing of the souls.
In the “Book of the Dead,” of which a copy was placed
in the tomb with every mummy, the defunct addresses
to the god a long enumeration of the good deeds he has
done and the faults he has not committed; it is remarkable
that he speaks, not of his oblations, but of his virtues.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c010'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>
<p class='c019'>At the point we have reached, the religious feeling has
attained the height of its development, and can henceforth
only decline, so that the third period need not detain us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>long. It may be summed up in the following formula: an
ever-growing predominance of the intellectual (rational)
element, a gradual effacement of the emotional element as
it tends to approximate to the intellectual feelings and to
come under that category.</p>

<p class='c017'>When the march of thought towards unity has reached
its limit in pure monotheism, the work of theologians and
especially of metaphysicians tends to refine the conception
of divinity, assumed as First Cause, or moral ideal, or both
at once, but always as an inaccessible ideal, visible only
in occasional glimpses. The logical, necessary, inevitable
consequence is the weakening of the emotional state. In
fact, we may lay down the following principle:—</p>

<p class='c017'>From the perception to the image, and from the image
to the concept, the concomitant emotional element keeps
on diminishing, other things being equal; for we must
take into account differences of temperament and individual
variations. This is only a summary way of stating what
I have so often said in Part I.: emotional states, beyond
all others, depend on physiological (visceral, motor,
and vaso-motor) conditions. Now it is clear that perception
is the operation which most rigorously demands complex
organic conditions. Among images or representations
there are two categories: the vivid and intense imagination
approximates, by its hallucinatory tendency, to the
percept; while the cold and dull imagination, which is a
bare outline of things, approaches the nature of a concept.
Finally, the pure concept, reduced almost entirely to a
sign, a substitute for reality, is as much detached from
organic conditions as it is possible for a psychic state to
be; it requires a <em>minimum</em> of physiology. In consequence,
emotion, attacked at its source, flows very scantily; and
of the religious feeling properly so called there remains
only a vague respect for the unknowable—for the x—the
last survival of fear and a certain attraction towards the
ideal which is the last remnant of the love dominant during
the second period.</p>

<p class='c017'>We might say in clearer and simpler terms that religion
tends to become a <em>religious philosophy</em>, which is an entirely
different thing, for each corresponds to a distinct psychological
condition, one being a theoretic construction of
argumentative reason, the other the living work of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>group of persons or an inspired great man, involving the
whole man, his thoughts and feelings. This distinction is
extremely important and throws light on our subject.</p>

<p class='c017'>It would be easy to show that the great religions, at the
height of their development, become transmuted into a
subtle metaphysic, accessible to philosophers only. For the
sake of impartiality, and not to shock any one, let us
place ourselves in a remote period. In India, the religion
which begins with the naturalism of the Vedas is organised,
becomes social and moral with Brahmanism, and attains a
transcendental ideality in the Bhâgavad-Gitâ. Take the
following passage, chosen at random among a hundred
similar ones:—"I am [Krishna is speaking] incomprehensible
in form, subtler than the subtlest of atoms. I am the
light of the sun and moon; beyond the darkness I am the
brightness of flame, the rays of everything that shines,
sound in the ether, perfume on the earth, the eternal seed
of all that exists, the life of everything. As wisdom, I live
in the hearts of all. I am the goodness of the good, I am
the beginning, the middle and the end, eternity of time, the
death and birth of all."</p>

<p class='c017'>Is this religion, or metaphysics, or rather a beautiful
philosophical poem, which moves us by the splendour of its
images? For such a doctrine to become a real religion
it must be concreted and condensed. That we may not,
however, seem to cavil and dispute about words, or come to
an arbitrary decision that the one thing is a religion and the
other a religious philosophy, we may state the question in
an objective form. As soon as religious thought ceases to
have a worship or a ritual, and indeed finds itself incompatible
with such, it is a philosophical doctrine. Stripped
of all external and collective character, of all social form, it
ceases to be a religion, and becomes an individual and
speculative belief. Such is the deism of the eighteenth
century, with all analogous conceptions, where feeling
is only present in a very slight, almost imperceptible,
degree.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us note, however, that in these periods of intellectual
refinement, feeling does not lose its rights: it has its revenge
in mysticism. In all great religions which have reached their
highest point, the antagonism between the two elements of
belief, the rational and the emotional, shows itself in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>opposition between dogmatists and mystics. History is
full of their mutual antipathy: in Christianity we find it,
from the Gnostics, through the schools of the Middle Ages
and Renaissance, to the “pure love” of the seventeenth
century and later. The same may be said of other
religions: Islam, in spite of its dry monotheism and the
poverty of its ritual, has not escaped the universal law; it
has had, and still has, its mystical sects. When we study
them we find that, for all the differences of time, place, race
and belief, the mystics, caring little for rigorous dogmatism,
all show a singularly strong family likeness to each other.
In this case it is argument which divides and feeling which
unites.</p>

<p class='c017'>We have still to examine one question relating to the
emotional element alone: is religious emotion a <em>complete</em>
emotion? It is worth while lingering over this, since many
writers (not to mention those who omit it altogether) set it
down as a variety of the intellectual feelings—<i>i.e.</i>, of the
coldest form of emotional life.</p>

<p class='c017'>A complete emotion, as we know, includes, besides the
purely psychic state, a somatic resonance, a vibration of the
organism, consisting (<i>a</i>) of changes in the circulation, the
respiration, and the functions in general; (<i>b</i>) of movements,
gestures and actions which constitute its proper mode of
expression. Without these, there is merely an intellectual
state. Does religious emotion fulfil these two conditions?</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>a.</i>) It has its physiological accompaniment; it penetrates
as far into the organism as any other. Since by its
very nature it contains, though in varying proportion, two
elements, depression and exaltation, let us very briefly survey
their physiological relations.</p>

<p class='c017'>Depression is related to fear and under its acute forms
has been confounded with it. Does not the worshipper
entering a venerated sanctuary show all the symptoms of
pallor, trembling, cold sweat, inability to speak—all that
the ancients so justly called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sacer horror</i></span>? Physical and
mental weakness makes us religious through consciousness
of human frailty. Austerities, macerations—in short,
the asceticism which is an institution in the so-called
pessimistic religions—though springing from a multitude of
causes which need not here be inquired into, prove at least
that the physiological factor is not regarded as indifferent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>The Hindoo ascetics of the early ages were able, by their
insensate mortification, to dethrone the gods and take their
places—gods in their turn. The widespread belief that
austerities contribute to salvation is a very much modified
form of this.</p>

<p class='c017'>Exaltation is related to love and tends to union, to
possession. The history of all ages abounds in physiological
procedures made use of for the artificial production
of enthusiasm in the etymological sense of the word, which
implies having the deity within one’s self.</p>

<p class='c017'>There are inferior forms: the mechanical exaltation
produced by dancing, or by the rhythmical music of
primitive tribes, which excites them and places them in
a favourable mental attitude for inspiration. Toxic exaltation:
soma, wine, the Dionysiacs, the Mænads. The
sanguinary means so widespread in the cults of Asia
Minor: the Bona Dea and Atys, the Corybantes, the
Galli, who mutilated and gashed themselves with sword
strokes; in the Middle Ages, the Flagellants; and in our
own day, Fakirs, dervishes, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>There are higher, less materialistic forms: the collective
excitement of pilgrimages and revivals, where the emotion
of each individual is increased by that of the rest; the
artificial means, known from antiquity, of attaining ecstasy,
<i>i.e.</i>, full possession; the frequent confusion, which has so
often excited the wrath of theologians, between the language
of carnal and that of mystical love.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c010'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>All these facts are well known, and thousands of others
are recorded in history. It is convenient to recall them
in order to show that they have their psychological reasons;
they are not aberrations, as might seem to be the case at
first sight, but the necessary conditions of intense emotion.
If it is objected that some of them border on madness,
we may reply that every violent passion does the same, and
sometimes crosses the border-line.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>b.</i>) The religious sentiment, again, is attached to
material conditions by its mode of expression, which is
ritual. Ritual practices are not, as many think, purely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>exterior and artificial, accessory and adventitious; they are
a spontaneous creation, originating in the nature of things.
Every religion, great or insignificant, is an organism constituted
by a fundamental belief attached to percepts,
images, or concepts, <em>plus</em> certain secondary notions which
are sometimes mutually contradictory, <em>plus</em> an emotional
state. All this forms a living whole, which evolves,
vegetates, or retrogrades. This organic character distinguishes
the positive religions from the purely theoretical
and metaphysical conceptions, which are not alive, never
have lived, and are nothing but pure speculation. Now, as
every animal organism, from the infusoria to man, has its relational
life,—<i>i.e.</i>, relations with external agents,—so religion,
as an organism, has its life of relations with the supernatural
and mysterious powers on which man believes himself to be
dependent. This life is expressed by rites, which are means
of action, methods of establishing a relation.</p>

<p class='c017'>The history of ritual is a chapter of the expression of the
emotions. The only difference is this: emotional expression,
in the sense given to the words by Duchenne, Darwin, their
successors, and the world in general, has an individualist
character, showing fear, anger, love, etc.; while ritual
expression has a <em>social</em> character; being the spontaneous
product of a collectivity, of a group, which has become
fixed and permanent, erected into an institution by the
influence of society, and safeguarded by tradition. On
this subject I cannot enter into detail; it is sufficient to
remind the reader that ritual is psychic in its origin.
There have been two principal phases in its development.</p>

<p class='c017'>During the primitive period, ritual is the <em>immediate and
direct</em> expression of the religious sentiment, and bears the
stamp of the national character. Among the Greeks, it was
graceful and joyous, as is fitting for divinities who are
merely superior and happy human beings. Among the
early Romans it has an agricultural and family character,
is formalist and methodical; the omission of the minutest
detail invalidates the sacrifice. The Mexicans immolated
human hecatombs to divinities who were intoxicated with
blood. Rationalist religions, being half philosophical, have
little ritual and a dry liturgy; they resemble persons of
phlegmatic temperament, whose gestures are rare and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>restrained. The religions of the imagination and the
heart, on the other hand, manifest themselves by the
splendour and exuberance of their ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the second period, we have the passage from the
literal to the figurative; ritual becomes <em>symbolism</em>. Since
it is a means of expression, a language, it is quite natural
that this should be so, and this phase corresponds to that
of metaphor in spoken language. Thus the offering of a
lock of hair, or a figure made of dough, becomes a substitute
for human sacrifice. Having reached this point, ritual can
no longer be understood except through its history; but
worshippers still use it, without fully knowing its meaning,
just as they use metaphors without knowing their
derivation, or being able to trace them back to their primary
sense. Lastly, there are some rites which are simply survivals,
analogous to a frown when we are perplexed, vestiges
of certain ways of feeling and acting which have been, but
have long ago disappeared.</p>

<p class='c017'>The religious feeling is therefore a complete emotion,
with its train of physiological manifestations, and those
writers who have classed it among the intellectual feelings
have only considered it under its higher forms, and when it
is on the point of extinction. At the period of its fullest
development, but rarely under either its primitive or its intellectualised
form, the religious feeling may become a passion,
yielding to no other in tenacity and violence, which has
its own special name: religious fanaticism. It borders
on madness without quite crossing the line. This passion
would require a psychological monograph to itself; and
there is no lack of documents whence to compose one.
We may gather from these facts:</p>

<p class='c017'>1. New proofs of the fundamental independence of the
religious and of the moral sentiments. In religious wars,
persecution, the torture inflicted on heretics, the murder of
the chiefs of the opposite party, are held to be meritorious
acts; all which seems inexplicable to persons of calm and
deliberate sense. They would be less astonished if they
would consider that religious emotion, when it reaches the
point of a paroxysm of passion, becomes as uncontrollable
as violent love, and, like it, must have satisfaction; that
there is the firm belief in a right, superior to human
obligations, because of higher origin (a belief attaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>its highest degree in theomania, of which we shall speak
presently); and that the religious sentiment and the moral
sentiment, though having numerous points of contact and
moments of fusion, are yet, in their nature, essentially
distinct, because answering to two totally distinct tendencies
of human nature.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. We find a proof of the tendency of the religious feeling
to unite, group, <em>socialise</em>. Unity of belief creates the religious
community, as community of external and internal interests
creates the civil community. Both tend to expel
dissidents (internal enemies), and to conquer external
enemies—in this case, the heathen.</p>

<p class='c017'>The distinct or vague consciousness of the conditions of
a society’s existence, <i>i.e.</i>, its instinct of conservation,
determines its morality and its way of acting. National
religions, therefore, which are the same thing as civil
society, proselytise only slightly, or not at all: the Greeks
never tried to convert the Persians, neither did the Romans
the Gauls. The universal religions (Christianity, Islam,
Buddhism) forming societies other than, and outside
nationality, and transcending it, have aimed at spiritual
conquest, <i>i.e.</i>, at their social extension.</p>

<p class='c017'>IV.</p>

<p class='c017'>The question whether there exist any tribes completely
devoid of all religious belief has been extensively discussed.
That there are any such seems doubtful, when we take into
account, on the one hand, the reticence of the savage
towards strangers with regard to his own feelings and
beliefs; and on the other, the scanty psychological equipment
of travellers, who frequently understand by religion
only a developed and organised cult. The fact, even were
it proved, would be but of slight value, since it could only
be the case among the very lowest specimens of humanity.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c010'><sup>[199]</sup></a>
A question scarcely ever asked is this: Are there <em>individuals</em>
(not social groups) utterly without religious
feeling? We must eliminate idiots, imbeciles, and the
uneducated deaf and dumb; we are speaking of normal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>men living in some society or other, all of which have a
religion. I am distinctly inclined to answer in the affirmative,
though I find no decisive observation on this point.
The case would be analogous to those of moral blindness
already studied, to the absence, if it exists, of all æsthetic
feeling; it would denote a lacuna in the emotional life. It
should be noted that it is only in this department that such
a lacuna can occur. No normal man, living in a society,
can have his mind closed to religious <em>ideas</em>, can ignore
their existence, their object, their significance; but they may
have no hold on him, may remain within his consciousness
as a foreign substance, originating no tendency and exciting
no emotion; they may be conceived without being felt.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have already reminded the reader that the religious
feeling may become a violent passion; it may even pass this
limit, take a chronic form, and enter the region of pathology.
For the alienist, religious madness is not a morbid entity,
but a symptom; it sometimes exists by itself, but is more
often associated with epilepsy, hysteria, and the forms of
melancholia. From a psychological point of view, it has to
be studied by itself, as a complement to the normal state.
Considered thus, from the purely psychological standpoint,
its manifestations, though very diverse, may be reduced to a
simple classification: the depressive, or asthenic; and the
exalted, or sthenic forms.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. The depressive forms spring up and grow on the soil
of melancholia. Their physiological criteria are the symptoms
so often described—lowering of the vital functions,
and so on. Their emotional criterion is fear in all its
varieties, ranging from the simple scruple to panic terror;
and the intellectual criterion, the possession by a fixed idea.
Religious madness follows a course depending on character,
education, environment, epoch, and form of belief. So
those who believe in predestination are tortured by the idea
of having committed the unpardonable sin. This obsession,
frequent among Protestants, is rare among Catholics, who
admit the possibility of absolution.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c010'><sup>[200]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>One form, which we might call <em>subjective</em>, consists in
religious melancholy pure and simple, in which the patient
believes himself continually guilty, rejected, damned. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>its anxious form it is characterised by scruples about everything,
lamentations over imaginary crimes or faults. This
state is connected with two primary emotions, both of which
have a depressive character: on one side fear, on the other
the self-feeling under its negative form of humility and
dejection. An unconscious or conscious course of reasoning
leads the subject to a feeling of abjectness and self-contempt;
he tries to weaken himself, to make himself
worthy of pity. Asceticism, though, rightly or wrongly,
invoking moral reasons in its own favour, rests on the
fundamental desire of depreciating the individual, at least
in this life. This appears, even in its simple and mitigated
forms, but still more in its extravagances (the monasticism
of the fifth century, Simeon Stylites, etc.), in the cases of
castration, mutilation, partial destruction, and finally, in the
religious suicide of the Hindoos who threw themselves
before the car of Jaganath.</p>

<p class='c017'>A second form, which for want of a better term may be
called <em>objective</em>, is demoniac melancholia—the delusion of
obsession or possession,—which, formerly superabundant
in all religions, has now become rarer.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c010'><sup>[201]</sup></a> In obsession, or
<em>external</em> demonomania, the patient is not in the true sense
possessed; he hears, sees, feels, smells the spirits who are
obstinately determined on his ruin, but he does not feel
them <em>within</em> him. In possession, or <em>internal</em> demonomania,
they are inside him. There is doubling of the personality,
with sensory, visceral, and psychomotor hallucinations, these
last consisting of internal voices which the possessed person
hears speaking inside him and in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. The morbid exaltation of the religious feeling is
derived from attraction and love, as depression springs from
fear. Related to joy, and sometimes to megalomania, it is
accompanied by partial or total augmentation of both the
physical and psychical life.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ecstasy is a transitory and comparatively passive form.
Seen from without, it resembles catalepsy in the insensibility
to external impressions, and suspension of sensory activity.
It differs from it on the motor side. The ecstatic has not
the “flexibility of wax” and the complete immobility; he
can move, walk, speak, and his face can assume any given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>expression. Seen from within, ecstasy is an intense state of
consciousness, of which the recollection remains after awaking,
while catalepsy is attended by unconsciousness, or, at
least, complete oblivion. Its psychology is simple enough,
if, neglecting details, we confine ourselves to the essential
conditions. The confessions of ecstatics, which are tolerably
numerous, agree in their principal features: (1) restriction
of the area of consciousness, with one intense and
overmastering representation serving as the pivot and only
centre of association; (2) an emotional state—rapture—a
form of love in its highest degree, with desire and the
pleasure of possession, which, like profane love, only finds
its end in complete fusion and unification (ἐνῶσις of the
Alexandrians). The declarations of the great mystics, however
involved they may be in metaphor, leave us in no
doubt on this point;<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c010'><sup>[202]</sup></a> and their critics, even theologians,
have reproached them with frequently being mistaken in the
nature of their love.</p>

<p class='c017'>A more stable and active form of religious exaltation is
theomania—<i>i.e.</i>, “a mental state in which the subject
believes himself to be God, or at least inspired by Him
to reveal His will to men.” To draw a hard and fast line
between the founders of religions, the reformers, the promoters
of religious orders, and pure theomaniacs, is as
difficult as to indicate the precise point at which a violent
love becomes madness. We might make use of a practical
test, and say that the one has succeeded where the others
have failed, but this would be too simple, success and
failure depending on a variety of causes. This discussion,
moreover, is out of place here. It is sufficient to remark that
theomania is, in its psychical characteristics, the complete
antithesis to demonomaniac melancholia. Instead of the
sorrow of the possessed person with the enemy lodged in
his own body, we find an unalterable joy, which can be
affected neither by persecution, nor misfortunes, nor tortures.
To the feeling of abjectness is opposed the delusion
of grandeur. However modest a man may be by nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>or as a result of reflection, he cannot with impunity believe
himself chosen by the Deity as His prophet, to speak and
act in His name.</p>

<p class='c017'>The preceding sketch, whence I have purposely eliminated
details and observations (of which, as is well known,
there is no lack), has but one object—viz., to show that the
primary constituents of the religious sentiment may serve as
a guide to its pathology, which rests entirely on fear and
love. I may add that none among morbid emotions has—and
still more, has had—a more marked tendency to
rapid propagation in epidemic form: a further proof that,
in its nature, it is not so much individual as social.</p>

<p class='c016'>While all the emotions hitherto enumerated have their
origin and their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>raison d’être</i></span> in the preservation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>individual as an individual, or as a social being, the
æsthetic feeling, as we know, differs from the rest by the
fact that the activity which produces it, aims, not at the
accomplishment of a vital or social function, but at the
mere pleasure of exercising itself. The more directly a
tendency is connected with life, the more necessary, urgent,
and serious it is, and the less it paves the way for the
æsthetic feeling, which must always have a surplus to
expend. However, its inutility, which is only relative, has
been exaggerated; for it tends in some measure to the
conservation of the individual and the race, being, and
especially having been in the past, a <em>social</em> factor, though
an incidental and subordinate one, as we shall see afterwards.</p>

<p class='c017'>In conformity with the plan adopted, we shall remain
strictly within the bounds of psychology, avoiding any
excursions into the history or theory of art, except for
the purpose of seeking facts and illustrations. We shall
thus have to study the origin of æsthetic emotion, the law
of its development, and, subsequently, two forms of
emotional life, rightly or wrongly, considered as related
to it: the sense of the sublime and that of the comic;
and we shall conclude by some remarks on its morbid
manifestations.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>On the origin of æsthetic feeling, and consequently on
the character peculiar to it among all other emotions,
writers belonging to all schools of philosophy are in agreement
to an extent rarely found elsewhere. It has its source
in a superfluity of life—a luxury of activity; in fact it is a
form of play. Schiller is supposed to have been the first to
state its formula: “Supreme art is that in which play
reaches its highest point, when we play, so to speak, from
the depths of our being. Such is poetry, and especially
dramatic poetry.... As the gods of Olympus, free from
all wants, knowing nothing of work or of duty, which are
limitations of being, occupied themselves in taking mortal
forms in order to play at human passions, so, in the drama,
we play with the achievements, crimes, virtues, vices, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>are not our own.”<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c010'><sup>[203]</sup></a> Kant referred the beautiful to the free
play of the intellect and the imagination, and his immediate
disciples follow him on this point. Schopenhauer says the
same thing in other words, “Art is a momentary liberation.”
Finally, Herbert Spencer develops this thesis, from the
experimental point of view, by connecting it with biological
conditions.</p>

<p class='c017'>The primary activity of our physical and mental faculties
relates to proximate ends: the conservation of the individual,
and his adaptation to his environment. The
secondary activity is its own end, and is of somewhat late
appearance in the animal kingdom. The lower animals are
shut up in a narrow circle: they feed, defend themselves,
sleep, and propagate their species. On a higher level
appears “a useless activity of unused organs” (Spencer,
<i>op. cit.</i>, ii. p. 630); as in the rat with incisors growing
continuously in adaptation to the excessive wear they
undergo; the cat, exercising her claws on the bark of a tree
or the covering of a chair, etc. Higher still appears the
true play-impulse; dogs pretending to hunt or fight, cats
running after a ball which they catch, push away, catch
again, and pursue, bounding as if after their prey. In
children, we know the pre-eminent function of play, and how
it differs according to sex, disposition, and age: it has its
individual characteristics, and is often a creation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Play is, however, a genus of which æsthetic activity is
only a species, and in determining the peculiarities of this
species, the authorities are somewhat vague.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c010'><sup>[204]</sup></a> The most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>definite, Grant Allen, in his <cite>Physiological Æsthetics</cite>, has
attempted a solution. For him play is the disinterested
exercise of the <em>active</em> functions, as in racing, hunting, etc.;
art, that of the <em>receptive</em> functions, as in the contemplation
of a picture or a monument, the reading of a poem, listening
to music, etc. This is definite, but quite inadmissible;
for it is clear that æsthetic emotion requires a certain
mental activity in the spectator, not to mention the
creator.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c010'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The peculiar characteristic of this superfluous activity, this
form of play, is the fact of its spending itself <em>in a combination
of images and ending in a creation which has its aim in itself</em>;
for creative imagination sometimes has practical utility as
its aim. It differs from the other forms of play only in the
materials employed and the direction followed. We may
say, more briefly, that it is the play of the creative imagination
in its disinterested form.</p>

<p class='c017'>This is not the place for a dissertation on the creative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>imagination, which seems to have been somewhat neglected
by contemporary psychology, so lavish in studies of
what used to be called the passive imagination (<i>i.e.</i>, visual,
auditory, motor, etc., images). I wish only to indicate,
as belonging to our subject, its relations to instinctive
activity.</p>

<p class='c017'>When we have said that images, their association and
dissociation, reflection, and emotion are the constituent
elements of the creative imagination, it will be found that
we have omitted an irreducible factor, the principal element,
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>proprium quid</i></span> of this mental operation, that which gives
the first impulse, which is the cause of creative work,
and constitutes its unity. This <i>x</i>, which, for want of a
better term, we may call spontaneity, is of the nature of an
instinct. It is a <em>craving</em> to create, equivalent, in the intellectual
order, to the generative craving in the physiological
order. It shows itself at first, modestly, in the invention of
childish games; later, and more brilliantly, in the budding
of myths, that collective and anonymous work of primitive
humanity; later still, in art properly so called. There
always remains the craving for superimposing on the world
of sense another world, having its origin in man, who
believes in it, at least for the moment. If it should seem
a mistake to compare instinct, which is fixed, with the
æsthetic activity, which passes for absolute liberty, we must
remember that we are dealing, not with their development,
but with their origin; and in that point they coincide.
<em>True</em> creative activity has the innateness of instinct, an
innateness in this case to be rendered by the word precocity.
This is proved by innumerable facts; at some unforeseen
moment the spark flashes out; experience has hardly
anything to do with it. It has its necessity and its
fatality; the creator has his task to accomplish; he is
fitted for one kind of work only; even when he has
some adaptability, he is imprisoned within his own manner,
and keeps his own individual style; if he leaves it, he fails
altogether, or becomes a bad imitator of others. It has
its impersonality; creation is not the child of the will, but
of that unconscious impulse which we call inspiration; it
seems to the creator as if another acted in him and through
him, transcended his personality and made him a mere
mouth-piece. What further is needed to show, as far as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>origin is concerned, the characteristics of instinct? In
physiological creation the fertilised ovule assimilates to
itself, according to its nature, the materials of its environment,
and, following the laws of an inexorable determinism,
becomes, in the end, a healthy individual or a monster. In the
case of instinct, an external or internal excitation brings into
play a pre-established mechanism, and the act goes straight
to its end, or turns to a gross error. In æsthetic
creation the process is identical; we know by means of
numerous biographical documents, which I cannot here
reproduce, that the creative moment with artists
presents itself under one or other of two forms: either a
rapid intuition, in which the generating idea appears as a
whole, or a fragmentary, partial view, which gradually
completes itself; unity established beforehand or arrived
at afterwards; the intuition or the fragment. The intellectual
ovule, too, is forced to this dilemma—revelation
or abortion.</p>

<p class='c017'>I do not insist on a subject which would require to be
dwelt on at length, and which I propose to treat in another
work where it will be more in place; but it was necessary
to point out that under this superabundance of strength,
this vaguely described useless activity, there is something
more definite, an active tendency utilising this superfluous
energy, and giving to it various directions, among others
that of intellectual creation, with images for materials—a
creative instinct having its type in primitive animism, the
common source of myths and arts.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let it not be objected that all this concerns the creator
only, and that he alone feels this craving, this tendency,
this inclination to act, which is the root of æsthetic emotion.
He who experiences it in any degree, however coarse or
however subtle—spectator, listener, dilettante—must perform
over again, in a measure proportioned to his powers,
the creator’s work. Without some analogy between their
natures, however slight, the spectator will feel nothing; he
must live the artist’s life and play his game, incapable of
producing by himself, but capable of being, and even forced
to be, an echo.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now let us lay aside these theoretic considerations for a
question of <em>fact</em>. Can we find the transition between play
under its simple form of movement, expended for the sake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>of pleasure, and æsthetic activity, <i>i.e.</i>, creation-play? This
transition must represent the origin and primitive form of
art. This primordial art, now impoverished, dried up, like
an old tree which has emptied all its sap into its suckers,
is dancing, or rather the pantomime-dance forming an inseparable
whole. In its origin it is “an expression of
muscular force simulating the acts of life.” No commentary
is needed to show that here the junction between superfluous
motor activity and æsthetic creation takes place:
dancing includes both. Since we are at the source, it is as
well to insist on this, all the more so, as the importance
of this primordial art has in general either been forgotten or
insufficiently emphasised by psychology.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c010'><sup>[206]</sup></a> Let us note its
principal characteristics.</p>

<p class='c017'>First of all, the artist finds his material in himself: a
possibility of movements useful neither for seeking food, nor
for defending himself, nor for attacking others, nor for his
preservation, or that of his species, in any form whatever.</p>

<p class='c017'>This art is primordial. We find it in the early stages
of all peoples and tribes, even the most savage. The
documents collected by ethnologists leave us in no doubt on
this point, except, perhaps, with regard to the Arabs and the
Fuegians; and, even in their case, there is nothing to
prove that it is not our insufficient information that is at
fault. We may therefore call it the natural art <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par
excellence</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is universal. It is found in all latitudes, all ages, all
races, as much among the utilitarian Chinese and the grave
Romans of the early ages, as among nations reputed artistic
or frivolous.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is symbolical, it means something, it expresses a
feeling, a state of mind; that is to say, it has the essential
and fundamental character of æsthetic creation. Originally,
dancing had a sexual, warlike, or religious significance; it
was appropriated to all the solemn acts of public and private
life. Among the natives of North America there were
dances for war, for peace, for diplomatic negotiations, for
hunting expeditions in common; others, again, for each of
the gods, for harvests, deaths, births, marriages. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>negroes have a passion for it which almost reaches delirium.
The ancient Chinese judged of the manners of a people
from their dances; they had themselves a great number,
bearing different names. This enumeration would be
endless; it is simpler to say that dancing marks a phase
of symbolism which all races of mankind have passed
through.</p>

<p class='c017'>Indubitably, in the genesis of the æsthetic sentiment, we
have here the first stage, semi-physiological, semi-artistic,
play becoming art. Let us further remark that primitive
dancing is a composite manifestation, including the rudimentary
form of two acts destined, later on, to separate in
the course of their evolution—music and poetry. Poor
music indeed, consisting sometimes of three notes only,
but remarkable for the strictness of rhythm and measure,
and poor poetry, consisting in a short sentence incessantly
repeated, or even in monosyllables without precise signification.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such is the original form of the arts aiming at motion.
As for the arts whose result is repose, they are, with the
exception of architecture, indirectly derived from the same
source. Dancing, being a pantomime, has plastic qualities;
it is living plasticity. Furthermore, as a social and ceremonial
act, it requires ornaments which at first were
applied to the human body: drawings, tattooings, or
colours simply smeared on. Later on, the representation
of forms and colours is externalised, passes from men to
things, in order to fashion or modify them, becoming ornamentation,
sculpture, painting.</p>

<p class='c017'>We have just seen how æsthetic activity arose, and how
humble was its origin. Another question still remains in
debate: <em>Why</em> was it evolved? In fact, by its nature, by
its definition, it seems to have had no utility as a
stimulant, since it springs from superfluous activity and
is not bound to the conditions of individual existence.
The persistence and development of the individual
social, moral, and religious emotions explain themselves
through utility. The intellectual or scientific emotion, also,
was at first entirely practical, and therefore useful: knowledge
is power. The case of æsthetic emotion stands alone.
How, amid the rough struggle for life in which humanity
was involved, was it able, not merely to blossom, but to live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>and prosper? It is no answer to say that it resisted and
grew, because rooted in an instinct, a craving; for this
instinct, by reason of its biological uselessness, might have
become atrophied, or disappeared, like functionless organs,
and it is the contrary that has happened. Darwin’s well-known
explanation based on sexual selection, the preference
of the females for the most skilful, the most graceful, the
most brilliantly coloured, or the best singers among the
males, is only partial, available for certain species of
animals, not for all. More than this, the tendency dominant
of late years to deny absolutely the heredity of
acquired modifications cuts us off from the hypothesis of
the transmission, consolidation, and increase of the æsthetic
instinct in the course of generations. Hence the great
embarrassment in which Weismann, Wallace, and all others
who take this negative view, find themselves. They admit
variation and selection only—not the fixing of variations
by heredity. The first factor is sufficient to explain the
appearance of the æsthetic activity, but the other two,
selection and transmission, have nothing to do with it; so
that, however frequently we may suppose this creative instinct
to appear, it would always have to begin again at the beginning.
The two above-mentioned writers have been much
exercised on this <a id='corr336.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='point'>point.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_336.23'><ins class='correction' title='point'>point.</ins></a></span> How could the aptitudes for mathematics,
music, and art in general, so rudimentary in primitive
man, take so marvellous a flight? “In the struggle for life
these mental gifts may very possibly have proved serviceable
from time to time, and even of decisive importance; but
in most cases they are not so, and no one will pretend that
a gift for music or poetry, ever, in primitive times, increased
the chances of founding a family.... These are not qualities
which favour the preservation of the species; they could not,
therefore, have been formed by natural selection.”<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c010'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>There is only one possible answer: æsthetic activity,
at its origin, had some indirect utility as regards
conservation, being based on directly useful forms of
activity to which it was auxiliary. Besides, to connect art
with play, itself connected with an excess of nervous and
muscular energy, is to place it in mediate relation with the
vital functions. We have still to define the nature and the
measure of its utility.</p>

<p class='c017'>The arts which aim at motion, at their first appearance
consisted entirely of dancing, accompanied by song.
Weismann tells us that the musical sound is the complement
of the sense of hearing, which itself is connected
with natural selection, because it is not a matter of
indifference, either for animals or men, that they should
clearly hear and rightly distinguish the sounds of inanimate
or animate nature, so as to act accordingly. This, however,
explains nothing, acuteness of hearing and musical
ear being two entirely distinct mental states, each requiring
distinct cerebral and psychic conditions. It is in the
dance accompanied by song and gesture that we must
seek for the explanation; it had a <em>social</em> utility, it favoured
concerted movements and common action, it gives unity,
and the consciousness and visual perception of unity, to
an assemblage of men; it is a discipline, a preparation
for corporate attack or defence, a school of war. Hence
the capital importance of <em>time</em>. The Kaffirs, in immense
numbers, sing and dance with such precision as to
resemble a huge machine in motion. Among several
tribes the rhythm must be perfect, and any one who
makes a mistake is punished with death.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c010'><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>In the case of the arts whose result is repose, the explanation
is more difficult. We have seen that there is a possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>transition from one group to the other,—dancing being a
living picture,—but what utility is there in the ornamentation
of utensils, in drawing, in sculpture? Wallaschek (<i>op.
cit.</i>) supposes that savages drew or carved horrible figures
on their weapons in order to frighten the enemy, as is still
seen among the Dyaks. I prefer Grosse’s explanation, as
being at the same time more positive and more general.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c010'><sup>[209]</sup></a> In
the first place, ornaments are signs, and have as such a
social value. Besides, and more especially, primitive
plastic art supposes two factors whose development must
be favoured among savages by the struggle for existence:
good visual memory and great manual skill. They are, like
children, very acute observers; they do not pass beyond the
narrow limit of their sensations; but within that limit they
see, hear, feel, and smell with extreme precision; their
existence depends on it. They have (as can be proved by
numerous instances) an excellent memory for forms and
figures. Lastly, they have few tools, but they know how to
use them; they are skilful because their life also depends
on their skill. The distance, therefore, between the practice
of arts serviceable to life and the primitive practice of art
is not so very great after all.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the beginning, art is dependent on and auxiliary to the
useful; the æsthetic activity is too wide to subsist by its
own strength; but it will be emancipated later on. We
shall return to the old question of the “relations between
the beautiful and the useful,” which cannot be cleared up
unless we turn our attention from civilised ages and
countries—where the divorce is already accomplished—to
the remote epoch of their origin.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Let us now, starting from its source, see how the æsthetic
sentiment has, in the course of ages, come to specialise and
differentiate itself. Its evolution presents two aspects—one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>sociological, the other anthropomorphic—which in the nature
of things are inseparable, but which, for the sake of clearness
in exposition, we shall study separately.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The æsthetic feeling, of a strictly social character in its
origin, tends progressively towards individualism. A division
of labour takes place in it, rendering its manifestations more
numerous and more complex.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The æsthetic sentiment, of a strictly human character
at its origin, gradually loses this in order to embrace the
whole of nature. It passes from human beauty in its
organic form to abstract beauty, loved for its own sake.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us consider its developmental progress under this
double aspect:</p>

<p class='c017'>I. In recent times, especially in France, many writers
have occupied themselves with the relations between the
æsthetic feeling and social conditions. It is sufficient to
mention the names of Taine, Hennequin, Guyau,<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c010'><sup>[210]</sup></a> but all
are studying the question under its contemporary, or at least
its civilised form; they place themselves at an epoch when
art has already to a great extent lost its social value. For
Hennequin, a form of art expresses a nation, because,
having adopted it, the nation recognises itself therein as
in a mirror. The famous theory (Taine’s) of the work of
art as the necessary product of race, time, and environment
is much contested and very vague. Still more vague is
Guyau’s view: “Art is, through the medium of feeling, an
extension of society to all natural beings and even to beings
conceived as transcending the limits of nature, or, in fact,
to fictitious beings, created by human imagination.” It is
an abuse to words to apply the name of society in this way:
a society implies solidarity; every other use of the word is
merely arbitrary. The question is, therefore, Has art been
a co-operative factor in the establishment of solidarity among
men? It is in this sense only that it has or has had a
social character. Now, to find in it this characteristic in a
clear, positive, incontestable form, we must go back to the
beginning, to an epoch when æsthetic needs collaborated in
social unity and served a social end. This characteristic is,
as we have already said, so evident—at least as far as the
arts resulting in movement are concerned—that it seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>preferable briefly to recapitulate how differentiation and
individualism gradually came about.</p>

<p class='c017'>We have seen that, in the beginning, dancing is everywhere
and always a collective manifestation, regulated and
safeguarded by tradition, later on by laws, as in the Greek
republics, and later still subject to the influence of fancy
and individual caprice—to the great scandal of the conservatives.
But the evolution of this art has been poor enough
when compared with its two acolytes, poetry and music.
Poetry, even when separated from dancing, long remains
inseparable from music; it is sung and accompanied by the
playing of an instrument. It is at first anonymous; whoever
the author may be, it is common property; it belongs
to the clan, the group, as if it were the work of all. Later,—the
first social differentiation,—there are found corporations
of poet-singers: the ἀοιδοὶ, rhapsodists, jongleurs, minstrels,
bards; among the higher Negro races of the Upper
Nile these corporations are held inviolable, even in time of
war.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c010'><sup>[211]</sup></a> Afterwards the poet’s individualism, freed from its
association with music, accentuates and asserts itself, and
becomes the definitive form among civilised nations. It
would not be rash to say that, in our day, poetry is tending
more and more in the direction of pure subjectivity and
absolute individualism. Stuart Mill even ventured to say,
“All poetry is of the nature of soliloquy”; and according to
him, “the peculiarity of poetry appears to lie in the poet’s
utter unconsciousness of a listener”;<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c010'><sup>[212]</sup></a> which proves how
little he understood of its true origin. I do not inquire
whether this sort of isolation in an ivory tower is a gain or a
loss for poetry; but I observe its growing frequency as
civilisation advances; the complete antithesis to its collective
character in the earliest ages.</p>

<p class='c017'>Indissolubly associated at first with dancing and poetry,
music shares the common destiny; it is subject to inflexible
rules, it is a State function, an instrument of education and
order. Its function among the Greeks, especially the Dorians,
is well known, as also its importance to philosophers who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>like Plato, wished to reform or reconstruct society. In two
other widely separated parts of the world, among absolutely
different people, we find, in China, 2000 years before our
era, a Minister of Music, whose importance is continually
insisted on by the philosophers; and in Mexico, before
the conquest, an official academy of music, regulating both
that art and poetry. It is therefore regarded as being, in the
first place, of social utility. It thus passes through a process
of evolution similar to that already described in the case of
poetry, slowly separates from it, and still more slowly takes
its great flight to become the least imperfect mode of expressing
the most refined and intimate feelings, and to admit
of no rule outside itself. The separation which took place at
the Renaissance between religious music, which is in its
essence collective, and secular music, which tends towards
individualism, would, if need were, supply other proofs in
support of the regular march of æsthetic evolution.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the group of plastic arts, the relation between æsthetic
activity and individual or social utility shows itself less
clearly, and rather under the form of a parasitical superfetation.
Here the evolution has started from two quite distinct
sources: the one, leading to no great results, is the ornamentation
of the human body, which, however, has, as we
have seen, a certain social value as a sign. The other,
architecture, is for this group the equivalent of dancing,
<i>i.e.</i>, the primordial and synthetic form whence differentiation
started. As soon as man had passed the period of caverns
and such shelters, and had learnt to construct durable
buildings, he worked at first for gods and kings, who
embodied the social order and were alone worthy of so
great an effort, or for the assemblies and deliberations of
the clan, as is seen even at the present day in the case of
many savages, whose rudimentary architecture is only shown
in the construction of the communal house. The work is
at once architecture, sculpture, and painting, forming an
inseparable whole, as do dancing, poetry, and music. Then
the association was gradually dissolved, the independence of
each art asserted itself, and each of these arts, at first
exclusively reserved for kings or the community at large,
afterwards entered the service of the rich and great, and,
in time, of every one, thus becoming more and more
individualised.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>In short, the relation between disinterested æsthetic
feeling, and practical, utilitarian ways of thinking, would be
scarcely intelligible if we confined our attention to civilised
ages. It has varied greatly, and in these variations we can
distinguish three principal stages.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first stage is that of close relation. Æsthetic
pleasure, in its rudimentary form, co-exists with the useful,
or rather, is involved with it in a common state of consciousness—the
agreeable. To be felt, it must possess some
individual or social utility. This mental state is still, at this
very hour, that of many human beings, probably of the
majority.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c010'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The second stage is that of loose relation. Emerson’s
saying, that what Nature at one time provides for use she
afterwards turns to ornament, is the formula which sums up
this period. The æsthetic feeling has no fixed connection
with the conservation of the individual; it is called up by
occurrences which give its distant, disinterested echo, serving
the purpose of pleasure only. The legends, the genii, fairies,
mythological beings who have become mere material for
poems, pictures, operas, were once a belief, a reality, a
terror, of which we retain only the similitude in the shape
of a game.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c010'><sup>[214]</sup></a> There are many reasons why the serf of the
Middle Ages was not inspired with any sort of poetry by the
Gothic castles or the donjons built on high rocks whose
ruins we admire. It is possible that one day, under some
entirely different civilisation, our factories, with their tall
chimneys, may become material for art by calling up
memories of a vanished past.</p>

<p class='c017'>The third stage is that of complete liberation, which has
its expression in the thesis of art for art’s sake. My object
is neither to defend it, nor to attack it, nor to pronounce
judgment on it, but simply to ascertain its existence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>theory and practice, and that it only makes its appearance
at a late age and in mature civilisation.</p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up: there is no more an innate and infused
notion of the beautiful than there is an innate and infused
notion of the good, but a system of æsthetics which comes
into being just as morality does; and the history of the
æsthetic feeling is that of its fluctuations during the process
of coming into being.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. The second aspect of its evolution consists in the
progressive movement which sets it free from strict anthropomorphism,
gradually withdrawing it from the purely human
and extending it so as to embrace everything. The best way
to follow this movement of extension is to put the question in
a concrete form, as Grant Allen has done.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c010'><sup>[215]</sup></a> What objects did
man at first consider beautiful, and in what order did he extend
this judgment? In so doing we avoid the disadvantages
of an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> proceeding and the risk of confusion.</p>

<p class='c017'>Human beings began by thinking that beautiful which
resembled themselves; the Australian woman admired the
Australian man, and the Fuegian man the Fuegian woman.
Primitive æsthetics have a strictly <em>specific</em> character, and
their relations with the sexual instinct are evident. At
this stage they can scarcely be distinguished from animal
æsthetics, if—which is a disputed point—animals are susceptible
to the æsthetic sentiment. In any case their dances,
their music, their tournaments, their ornaments, are only
addressed to individuals of their own species, and have
generation as their object. There is no fact to indicate
that, for any species whatever, there has been any change
or progress in this direction.</p>

<p class='c017'>Man, on the other hand, rose out of this state, in the
first instance, by ornaments added to his person. This
addition may seem futile enough, but in reality it was
the first step outside nature. It has been attempted to
define man as a rational, or a religious animal; he might
just as well be defined as an æsthetic animal.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c010'><sup>[216]</sup></a> In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>colours and designs applied directly on the body, and at a
later period fixed by the operation of tattooing, we already
note a choice, a symmetry, a certain artistic arrangement.</p>

<p class='c017'>From the human body the artistic instinct then extends
to whatever comes in contact with it; it externalises itself,
and is applied to weapons, shields, garments, vases, utensils.
From the polished stone age onward we find a whole arsenal
of ornament. In caverns and tumuli of a date anterior to
the use of metals we find necklaces, bracelets, pins, and
rings of pleasing shapes. There exist numerous and correct
representations of various animals drawn or carved at a time
when the reindeer was still living in Central Europe.</p>

<p class='c017'>We may pass over architecture, an art which was useful
from the first, and of which I have already spoken. It
might, if necessary, be classed as an extension of clothing.
Let us only note that, as far back as the epoch of the lake-dwellings,
we observe the taste for symmetry; it is natural
and innate, and probably derived from an organic source in
the arrangement of the human body, the two halves of which
exactly resemble one another.</p>

<p class='c017'>The poetry of the earliest ages is as yet undifferentiated;
being at once epic, dramatic, and lyric. The generic
division was established later on, but all are characterised
by the common trait of being exclusively human, being
concerned with man, with human actions and human
feelings only. Nature is absent, or nearly so, from the
<cite>Iliad</cite>, the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Nibelungenlied</cite></span>, the <cite>Song of Roland</cite>, etc. The
poet is moved only by those whom Nietzsche calls <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Uebermenschen</i></span>,
gods or deified men, kings, heroes; and it is
only gradually that art descends to the middle classes or
the populace, to the humblest representatives of humanity.</p>

<p class='c017'>We need not discuss the origin of music, which has given
rise to various hypotheses; but we find it associated with
dancing, at first in vocal form, <i>i.e.</i>, translating human
emotions by means of the human organ. Very soon it
objectivises itself in instruments of percussion, extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>rough, but sufficient to mark time or rhythm accurately,
and also to produce a certain physical exaltation of the
senses. Then comes the imitation of the human voice by
means of the flute, and other wind or stringed instruments;
and the ever-growing desire to give utterance by means of
music to the most delicate shades of emotion has brought
into existence instruments of increasing flexibility, number,
and complexity, from the invention of the organ (in the
Alexandrian age) up to our own day when instrumentation
plays the preponderant part.</p>

<p class='c017'>At an early stage the æsthetic activity was exerted to
bring animals into its domain, especially the domestic
animals, companions or servants of man, as is proved by
the paintings or sculptures of India, Egypt, Assyria. The
horses of warriors became characters in heroic poems; so
do the dog of Ulysses and that of the Pandavas in the
Hindu epic. They take their place in art by reason of
their moral virtues—bravery, fidelity, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>At last we come to the stage where the æsthetic feeling is
quite <em>dehumanised</em>; it is no longer attached to men or
animals, but to the vegetable and inorganic world: it is the
appearance of the “feeling for nature.” Its late appearance
is a recognised fact, and I think it needless to accumulate
citations in proof. In primitive poetry, as we have
just said, man occupies the foreground; nature is only
an accessory. Very little description suffices in the beginning—a
few lines, or a few epithets merely. Even
at a later date, the Greeks, says Schiller, “artistic as
they were, and blessed with so genial a climate, have some
accuracy in the description of a landscape, but only as they
might describe a weapon, a shield, or a garment. Nature
appears to have interested their understanding rather than
their feelings.” The Greco-Roman period became conscious
of some artistic communion with nature only in the so-called
decadent epoch—<i>i.e.</i>, that of advanced civilisation (Euripides,
the Alexandrians, the Augustan age, and especially
the age of Hadrian). Landscape painting seems to have
been almost unknown among the ancients. Humboldt, in
his <cite>Cosmos</cite>, points out that, in the long catalogue left to us
by Philostratus of the pictures of his time, we find, quite by
way of exception, the description of a volcano. In the
time of the Roman Empire mural paintings became a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>fashion, but they depicted only a tame and cultivated
nature.</p>

<p class='c017'>Without insisting on well-known facts, we may say that
the æsthetic conquest of nature has passed through two very
definite stages. During the first, art reproduces a smiling,
cultivated, fertile nature, close to man, fashioned by him,
bent to his needs, <em>humanised</em>. Such are the Pompeian
paintings, and those found in the villas of the Roman
Campagna or the shore of Pozzuoli. During the second,
the taste for primitive, wild, untamed nature is developed, for
the stormy sea, the boundless deserts, glaciers, inaccessible
peaks. The taste for scenery of an abrupt or violent
character only dates, it is said, from the time of Jean-Jacques
Rousseau;<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c010'><sup>[217]</sup></a> certainly, in the eyes of the ancients, and for
centuries afterwards, such scenery consisted merely of horrible
spectacles, to be avoided if possible. The Romans, who so
often passed through Switzerland, found no beauty there;
and it will be remembered that Cæsar, when crossing the
Alps, composed a treatise on grammar to beguile the
tedium of the journey. Even in modern times the
revelation of tropical countries and their terrible grandeur
has had but a tardy effect on poetry and art. In the
present age, an immense majority of people feel only
repelled by the wildness of nature. It is, therefore, only
for the pleasure of the minority and within the last century
that the relative positions have been inverted; the human
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dramatis personæ</i></span> becoming accessories, and nature furnishing
the main subject of the picture.</p>

<p class='c017'>This lateness in the appearance of the feeling for nature
has been accounted for in a variety of contradictory ways.
Some consider that this feeling is awakened by contrast;
the satiety of civilisation and disgust at its refinements drive
man from it, at least in imagination, and lead him to seek
another ideal elsewhere. Others (Schneider, Sergi) appeal
to ancestral influences; primitive man feared nature more
than he enjoyed her charms (as is still the case with
peasants and children), wild nature, especially, inspiring
him with a superstitious terror, and being, as he believed,
full of maleficent spirits. This terror lasted for a long time,
even after the conception of the world had been changed
by the increased knowledge of physical phenomena, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>an echo from ancient times. Grant Allen points out that
facility of communication implies an advanced state of
civilisation; however practical the explanation may appear,
it is not without value; the traveller who has to make his
way across unexplored glaciers, or through virgin forest,
is engaged in unceasing effort and struggle for mere life,
which is incompatible with the disinterested character of
æsthetic contemplation. One needs a certain security to be
able to admire.</p>

<p class='c017'>These explanations seem to me only partial. The
true psychological reason lies in the natural extension of
sympathy. We have elsewhere seen that it implies two
principal conditions: an emotional temperament and a
comprehensive power of representation. These conditions
are most likely to be met with in a highly civilised generation,
whose sensibilities are exceedingly acute and subtle,
and their faculty of comprehension greatly extended.</p>

<p class='c017'>The conquest of nature by intellect and emotion takes
place through a process identical in both cases. There is
an ascending movement of the intellect, which, by way of
abstraction and generalisation, goes on to seek resemblances
less and less obvious, and increasingly difficult to grasp.
Certain races stop at the lowest stages: some ages never
pass beyond a certain average of knowledge—<i>e.g.</i>, the first
centuries of the Middle Ages. In the same way, there
is a progressive movement of feeling towards analogies in
nature of ever greater tenuity, and the same remark applies
to races and epochs.</p>

<p class='c017'>It has been said that the pantheistic tendencies peculiar
to certain peoples, such as those of India, are favourable to
a more rapid development of the feeling for nature. This
is, in fact, the thesis of sympathy under another form, since
the assumed community of nature among all beings involves
a community of feeling.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us note, in conclusion, that this extension of the
æsthetic feeling to inanimate nature is produced by a
process analogous to that which explains the genesis of
benevolence. The pleasures and pains belong to us, but
we attach them to the objects which occasion them; what
we call the soul of things is our own soul projected outside
ourselves and imparted to the things which have been
associated with our feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>By a few facts, chosen out of a vast number at our
disposal, I have tried to show that the æsthetic feeling has
progressed by evolution from the social form to that of
individualism, and from man to nature. This mode of
<em>objective</em> exposition has seemed to me preferable, because it
allows us to seize in a concrete and verifiable shape the
law of its development and increase in complexity.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>
<p class='c019'>It is usual to include under the same heading as the
æsthetic sentiment two other emotions, that of the
sublime and that of the comic, though I can only perceive
a somewhat vague analogy and partial affinities
between them. We shall attempt to see wherein these
three states approximate to and differ from one another.</p>

<p class='c017'>"The feeling of sublimity is that peculiar emotion which
is excited by the presentation or ideal suggestion of vastness,
whether in space or time (Kant’s ‘mathematical’ sublime),
or physical or moral power (Kant’s ‘dynamical’ sublime)."<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c010'><sup>[218]</sup></a>
The distinction generally drawn between the mathematical
and the dynamical sublime appears to me quite
secondary, as the two cases reduce themselves to the idea
of a force in action. Current opinion asserts that the
emotion of the sublime is simpler than the æsthetic emotion
properly so called. If we understand by this that the latter
is richer in its development, much more complex, much
more varied in aspect, comprehending the pretty, the
graceful, the purely beautiful, the pathetic, etc., the opinion
cannot be disputed; but if we mean that the sense of
sublimity is simpler as regards its origin, we cannot admit
it. I have already given the emotion of the sublime as
an example of a binary combination (Part II., Chap. VII.)
formed by synthesis of (<i>a</i>) a painful feeling of oppression,
dejection, lowered vitality, reducible to one primary emotion—fear;
(<i>b</i>) the consciousness of a rush, of violent energy in
action, of a heightening of vitality, reducible to one primary
emotion—the sense of personal power, “self-feeling” under
its positive form. Moreover, one negative condition is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>necessary: the conscious or unconscious feeling of our
security in the presence of some formidable power. Without
this last all æsthetic feeling disappears.</p>

<p class='c017'>The sentiment of the sublime loses the egoism which lies
at its root by extending, through sympathy, to men and
things. In participating, through the imagination, in the
grandeur of a real or fictitious personage,—the Napoleon of
history, the Moses of Michael Angelo, the Satan of Milton,—the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego</i></span> is objectivised and alienated. It is the history of
this development that we must now follow.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Human might,” says Bain, “is the true and literal
sublime, and the point of departure for the sublimity of
other things.” This is, in fact, the starting-point. Grant
Allen<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c010'><sup>[219]</sup></a> has brilliantly illustrated this view, by trying to
demonstrate that the feeling of the sublime has been
evolved from a narrow anthropomorphism—the admiration
for man’s physical strength—towards the sublimity of moral
and intellectual qualities, and that of mass and time in
nature. This conception deserves to be given in a condensed
form, though it is somewhat of an outline, and not
without lacunæ: neither is it certain, whatever this writer
may say, that the terror with which man was inspired by
natural phenomena did not show itself at a very early
period, in a form approaching to the emotion of sublimity.</p>

<p class='c017'>According to Grant Allen, the earliest object of human
admiration—<i>i.e.</i>, of a feeling of respect mingled with fear—is
the strong man, the invincible warrior, whom none can
resist. This feeling shows itself even among the higher
animals, with regard to each other, and still more unmistakably
among children: they admire physical strength. In
the course of social progress, the chief or despotic king,
with power of life and death over all, becomes the incarnation
of power—the sublime object—and so the feeling is
specialised. After his death, it is believed that his surviving
“double,” or ghost, is invested with the same, or even
greater privileges. Thus the feeling hitherto enclosed within
the world of experience is transferred to a supersensuous
region.</p>

<p class='c017'>The author might have shown that, at this stage of
evolution, the idea of an intellectual power, proved by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>superior knowledge and foresight, and that of a great moral
power, proved by courage and energy in effort, must have
inspired the same feeling.</p>

<p class='c017'>As, at this period, everything in nature is conceived as
alive, man has necessarily assimilated natural forces to
human power: as with thunderstorms, hurricanes, earthquakes,
and volcanoes. Looking at mountains, he seems to
see a superhuman power which has raised them. Finally,
the movement of thought, continually going on, leads to
the idea of a paramount or sole deity, considered as absolute
and unlimited power, and the maker of all.</p>

<p class='c017'>As for the sublimity of mass, it was probably first felt in
presence of great monuments, temples, palaces, pyramids,
tombs, constructed by the pride of kings, and suggesting the
idea of their vast power and the enormous amount of human
strength expended. As for sublimity in the immensity
of time, it is not attached to the conception of empty
and abstract time: it moves us because it appears to us as
peopled by a myriad of past or possible events, of activities
succeeding each other with unfailing prodigality.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus all these cases are reduced to an overwhelming
force, conceived by analogy and felt by sympathy. Taking
this evolution in its main lines, it has passed through two
principal periods, one of predominant terror, which is not and
cannot be æsthetic, and one of predominant admiration and
sympathy, where the consciousness of personal safety gives
the feeling a disinterested character: here emotion has
<em>become</em> æsthetic. It is probable, says Sully, that this feeling
passed from a disagreeable into an agreeable one, and
became æsthetic “through the elimination of the gross
element of personal fear.”<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c010'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Attempts have been made to reduce the emotion of the
sublime to a contrast; it rests rather on a harmony, a
synthesis of contradictories (in the Hegelian sense); it is a
case of <em>combination</em>, as we have tried to show in another
part of this work. It is neither fear nor pride (consciousness
of strength) felt directly or by sympathy, but a product of
their coexistence in consciousness, and their fusion in a
special state which can never be completely dissociated
by analysis. In short, it is far more closely related to
the two primary feelings already named than to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>æsthetic feeling, to which it approximates, not by nature,
but by accident.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c010'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c021'>IV.</h4>
<p class='c019'>It is also through an abuse of language that the emotional
state designated by the various names of a sense of the
laughable, of the ridiculous, of the comic, is considered as
a department of æsthetic emotion, for no other reason, as
it seems, than because the comic enters into all the arts
and produces a disinterested pleasure. Its domain, however,
extends far beyond this. It has been closely studied
in the general and special works of Darwin, Piderit,
Spencer, L. Dumont, Hecker, Kräpelin, and others; and I
do not propose to dwell on it at length, having very little to
offer in the way of personal opinion on the subject. Yet this
manifestation of the affective life, with its peculiar mode of
expression, laughter, cannot be omitted from a complete
treatise on the feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'>This subject presents two aspects, one internal, subjective,
psychological, the other external, objective, physiological.
The latter presents no difficulties, being susceptible of an
exact description; but to connect it with an internal cause,
to say why one laughs, is a very difficult problem, which has
been solved in various manners. In my opinion the error
lies in thinking that laughter has <em>a cause</em>. It has very
distinct <em>causes</em> which, seemingly, can be reduced no further,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>or, at least, their unity has not hitherto been discovered. If
we were to recount only a few of the numerous definitions
of laughter current in books, we should find none that
was not in some way open to criticism, because there is
none which embraces the question in all its manifold
aspects. Thus L. Dumont, in a special work on Laughter,
says, “It is an assemblage of muscular movements, corresponding
to a feeling of pleasure.” Is the laughter
caused by tickling, by cold, or by the ingestion of certain
substances, the hysteric laughter alternating with tears, the
nervous laughter of soldiers in action, after the moment
of danger is over—are all these to be put down to the
account of pleasure? Even if we class these and
analogous facts by themselves, as purely reflex actions,
there still remain difficulties.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Considered from the purely psychological point of view,
the mental state which shows itself in laughter consists,
according to some, in the consciousness of incongruity, of
a certain kind of contradiction; according to others, in a
consciousness of superiority in relation to men and things
on the part of the laugher.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first view seems to number most adherents. It
assumes as a fundamental fact the grasping of a contrast
between two perceptions, images, or ideas. Yet all contradictory
contrasts do not make us laugh; if they are to do so,
they must fulfil certain conditions. In the first place, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>two contradictory elements must be given simultaneously as
belonging to the same object, so as to induce us to think
that a thing both is and is not at the same time. A
monkey makes us laugh, because he reminds us of, but is
not, a man; he makes us laugh still more if dressed in
human clothes, because the contradiction is more striking.
Next, the two states of consciousness must be very nearly
of the same mass and intensity—a broken-down old man
carrying a heavy burden does not make us laugh. “The
two contradictory forces brought into play in laughter,
being unable to attain to the unity of a conception, are
forced to escape outwards by an expenditure of muscular
energy” (L. Dumont).</p>

<p class='c017'>The second theory, first formulated by Hobbes, but
perhaps of still earlier date, is as follows: “The passion of
laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden
conception of some eminency in ourselves by comparison
with the infirmity of others or with our own formerly.”<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c010'><sup>[222]</sup></a>
The partisans of this view have severely criticised the
theory of incongruity, or discordance in things. “An
instrument out of tune, a fly in ointment, snow in May,
Archimedes studying geometry in a siege; ... everything of
the nature of disorder; ... and whatever is unnatural; the
entire catalogue of the vanities given by Solomon—are all
incongruous, but they cause feelings of pain, anger, sadness,
loathing, rather than mirth.”<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c010'><sup>[223]</sup></a> This view is quite as open
to criticism as the preceding; and we might enumerate a
long list of cases where the feeling of superiority, whether
justifiable or not, does not make us laugh. In my opinion,
both views ought to be admitted, as being partially true,
and meeting distinct cases.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second theory is suited to the primitive and lower
form of that emotional state which shows itself in laughter.
In the case before us, this state is directly derived from the
sense of strength or power, or, as Hobbes calls it, glory;
the contradictory contrast, if perceived at all, is in the
background. The coarsest and most brutal, almost physiological,
expression of this mental state, is the laugh of the
savage after a victory, when treading his vanquished enemy
under foot.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>“It appears to be fairly certain, not only that laughter is
a concomitant of brutality and cruelty among uncivilised
races, and children, but that even in the cases of the more
refined and benevolent, it is apt to accompany the recognition
of any slight loss of dignity in another, when this loss
does not evoke other and painful feelings.”<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c010'><sup>[224]</sup></a> It is a matter
of common observation, that many people have a tendency
immediately to burst out laughing at any accident, even if
serious, happening to others; and this instinctive laughter
certainly does not spring from the good side of human
nature. It is clear that, under this form, laughter has
nothing to do with æsthetics.</p>

<p class='c017'>The theory of discord suits well with the secondary and
superior forms: the feeling of superiority becomes effaced
and passes into the background. It is an intellectualised
manifestation, which has or may have an æsthetic value,
the mental development permitting those fugitive and subtle
contradictions which constitute the principal element of the
comic to be caught on the wing. It takes on an almost
disinterested character, though never, perhaps, completely
losing its original blemish.</p>

<p class='c017'>Finally, laughter may take a still more elevated form in
the humorous spirit we have already mentioned (Part II.,
Chap V., 3), in which the feeling of superiority is mitigated
by a large proportion of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The nature of laughter would be very incompletely
known were we to confine ourselves to pure psychology,
but the physiological study of this phenomenon has not
been neglected. The description will be found in special
works on the expression of the emotions, especially in
Darwin (chap. viii.). Laughter is a strengthened expiratory
movement; when prolonged, the excess of the expirations
over the inspirations necessitates deep sighs in order
to restore the equilibrium; there is a drawing back and
raising of the corners of the mouth, the eyes become
brighter through the quickening of the circulation. According
to Darwin, the uninterrupted gradation from violent
laughter (which in all human races is accompanied by
tears) to moderate laughter, a broad smile and a gentle
smile, proves their common nature; but is laughter the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>complete development of the smile, or the smile a modified
form of the noisy laughter of the first period? Evolutionists
are, in general, inclined to consider noisy laughter as the
primary form, connected with the brutal sense of superiority.
Yet the early appearance of the smile in infants, at about
two months, while laughter is not observed, as a rule, till
the fourth month, seems, on this theory, to contradict the
principle that the evolution of the individual reproduces, in
an abridged and accelerated form, the evolutionary process
of the species. On the other hand, animals do not give
us any information on this point. Certain monkeys smile
or laugh—<i>i.e.</i>, the corners of the mouth are drawn back,
their eyes become brilliant, and they emit a certain sound
approximating to a chuckle (Darwin, Wallace, Mantegazza,
etc.).</p>

<p class='c017'>But the important point is to know why this collection of
physiological facts is connected with certain mental dispositions.
If laughter were the constant and exclusive
expression of joy and pleasure, the answer would be easy;
as in addition to this it is sometimes morbid, sometimes
futile and simply physiological, the explanation ought to be
framed to include all these cases.</p>

<p class='c017'>Herbert Spencer has proposed one, which, though published
some time ago (1863), still remains one of the most
satisfactory. In his view<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c010'><sup>[225]</sup></a> laughter is due to a sudden
diversion of nervous energy into a new path—an overflow-channel.
The excitation of the nervous system existing
at any given moment, especially if intense, can only be
expended in three ways—either by transmission to some
other part of the cerebro-spinal organism, exciting other
feelings or thoughts; or by acting on the viscera, the
heart, lungs, and digestive organs; or else by producing
muscular movements; and, as the nervous discharge,
especially if moderate, follows the line of least resistance,
and the most easily moved muscles are the first to be
shaken, it acts on the vocal organs, on the mouth, and on
the face. Laughter is connected with this last line of
action.</p>

<p class='c017'>It may result from purely physical excitants: tickling,
cold, toxic action, sudden relaxation after a long period
of constraint.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>It may be connected with representations—<i>i.e.</i>, have a
psychical cause. Spencer admits the theory of incongruity,
and defines it more precisely. He distinguishes the ascending
incongruity, which goes from the less to the greater,
and the descending incongruity between the greater and
the less. The latter alone provokes laughter. There must
be a sudden transition from one intense state of consciousness
to one which is much less intense, while forming a
complete contrast to it. Thus, while we are listening to a
symphony, a sneeze on the part of one of the spectators may
make us laugh. During a reconciliation scene, on the stage,
between two lovers, after a long estrangement, a goat begins
to bleat, and so introduces a comic element. The heightened
attention of the first moment is suddenly transferred to a
trifling incident which does not supply it with sufficient
matter on which to expend itself; the surplus has to find
an outlet, and this produces laughter.</p>

<p class='c017'>The excess of emotion, when it does not give a shock to
the whole frame, and is not the result of a contrast, takes
another direction—<i>e.g.</i>, the automatic actions of certain
barristers or other public speakers, of the embarrassed
schoolboy twisting his pen between his fingers, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>Hecker, in a special work, propounds another hypothesis.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c010'><sup>[226]</sup></a>
He connects everything with a typical fact—tickling, which
explains the laughter arising from physical, and that arising
from mental causes.</p>

<p class='c017'>In tickling, there is, first, the effect produced by each
cutaneous sensation: excitement of the vaso-motor and
the great sympathetic nerves, dilatation of the pupil,
brightness of the eyes, constriction of the vessels, as may
be verified experimentally in the application of a mustard
plaster or a sudden effusion of hot water. There is
another necessary condition: intermittence; for tickling,
there must be change in the rate or direction of the movements,
or interruption.</p>

<p class='c017'>The expiration corresponds to the moment of contact,
the expiration to that of interruption; in the first case the
diaphragm is raised, in the second lowered. To sum up,
tickling is an intermittent excitation of the skin producing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>an intermittent excitement of the vaso-motor nerves and
the respiration, and an alternation of pleasurable and uncomfortable
states. But what is the use of laughter in this
occurrence? Its function is protective, it compensates for
the diminished pressure of the blood on the brain; the
frequent expirations which compress the thorax, and consequently
the heart, the larger vessels and the lungs, prevent
the blood-vessels from emptying themselves.</p>

<p class='c017'>As to intellectually-caused laughter, Hecker, who borrows
his psychology from the æsthetician Fischer, and seems to
fuse together the two theories of contrast and superiority,
traces all manifestations of this kind to the comic. Now,
in the comic there are two simultaneous states: one, pleasurable,
the sense of our own superiority; the other unpleasant,
the contradiction in the object. Hence a rapid
alternation of pleasure and pain. The comic is an intermittent
impression, which acts like tickling; it is a psychical
titillation which, like the other, shows itself in laughter, and
for the same cause. Such is Hecker’s theory in its main
outlines.</p>

<p class='c017'>In conclusion, laughter manifests itself in circumstances
so numerous and heterogeneous—physical sensations, joy,
contrast, surprise, oddity, strangeness, baseness, etc.—that
the reduction of all these causes to a single one is very
problematical. In spite of all the work devoted to so
trivial a matter, the question is far from being completely
elucidated.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>V.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The pathology of the æsthetic sentiment would require a
work to itself.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c010'><sup>[227]</sup></a> We must here confine ourselves to some
remarks on the most general physiological conditions producing
it, and on the natural causes nearly always at work
to produce deviation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Can the faculty of artistic feeling be absolutely wanting?
Are there cases of complete insensibility to every artistic
manifestation, however humble? I do not think it in any
wise rash to affirm this. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>A priori</i></span> since the existence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>moral blindness and religious indifference is certain, it is
improbable that a superfluous emotion should have, in all
men without exception, an indelible character. As a matter
of fact, it is difficult to supply the proof; the insensibility
passes unnoticed, having no injurious consequences to the
individual or to society. However, partial cases, at least,
may be observed. Total insensibility to music is not rare,
and if this is a known fact, it is because it is the most easily
verified.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c010'><sup>[228]</sup></a> Many people declare that the reading or hearing
of poetry bores and wearies them to an extreme degree, and
they cannot understand why poets take so much trouble,
when it would be so much easier to express themselves in
prose.</p>

<p class='c017'>Leaving these extreme cases in order to consider pathology
proper, we may first ask ourselves whether we really
have here a subject for study, or whether we are pursuing a
mere chimera. The question is not here put quite in the
same form as elsewhere. Pathology signifies disorder,
deviation, anomaly; now, in æsthetic activity, where is
the rule? It has often been repeated that the essence
of art is absolute liberty. I see no objection to this
statement; art has its end in itself, and is subject to no
other requirement than that of creating works able to live,
accepted by contemporaries, and, if possible, by posterity
also. By what method, then, can we decide that any given
æsthetic manifestation is normal or abnormal? Such a
decision can be merely arbitrary. We have not even the
resource of saying that everything belonging to beauty is
healthy, and everything belonging to ugliness unhealthy;
for—not to mention that the line of demarcation between
the two is frequently very vague—the ugly is admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>into all the arts by way of ingredient or foil, and one
author (Rosenkranz) has even written on the “Æsthetics
of the Ugly.” I see only one way of escaping from the
difficulty, viz., transposing the subject, studying, not the
pathology of the æsthetic feeling itself, but that of the
source whence it emanates; in other words, considering it
merely as a symptom. This requires some explanation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Every failure of harmony between the tendencies which
constitute a healthy human being shows itself in a disturbance
of equilibrium, an anomaly in the affective life. This
deviation from normal life may be considered under two
aspects: one general, the other special; one human, the
other professional.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we consider it under its general form—<i>i.e.</i>, as simply
inherent in the human constitution—the want of equilibrium
expresses itself in many ways, following different directions
according to temperament, character, and circumstances,
such as melancholia, phobias, sexual aberrations, irresistible
impulses, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we consider it under its special, particular form, as
peculiar to a given individual carrying on a given occupation
and having given habits of life—an artisan, a labourer,
a tradesman, a lawyer, a physician, etc.—the disturbed
balance will appear to us as setting its mark on the individual’s
professional activity and its products. The artisan
will pass from a fury of work to excesses of idleness or
drink; the merchant from exaggerated caution to a reckless
daring in his enterprises; and the same in every trade
or profession. Now art is a profession like any other, and
the artistic <em>product</em> must bear the mark of the craftsman—a
mark of disequilibrium in the present case. Consequently
the anomalies of the æsthetic sentiment may be studied by
comparison, not with an imaginary norm, not with any
alleged regulative principles of art with which we are unacquainted,
but with a psychological criterion; they may be
studied as the effects and the revelation of a morbid
diathesis. To speak more simply, we have to deal, not
with æsthetics, but with psycho-pathology in connection
with æsthetics.</p>

<p class='c017'>Even thus transposed, the subject still presents inevitable
difficulties, the principal being as follows. With regard to
the psycho-physiological constitution of the creative artist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>there are two theories. (We must not forget that, in the
amateur, or mere taster of works of art, the same psychological
conditions are required, though in a less degree,
being more strongly accentuated in proportion as he feels
more acutely.)</p>

<p class='c017'>One of these theories, set forth in many well-known
works, maintains that æsthetic superiority is incompatible
with health of mind and body. The facts in support of it
have often been very uncritically collected, and among the
characters mentioned as typical we find all sorts. Among
creative artists there are vigorous men and puny ones, tall
and short, handsome and deformed, weak-willed and enterprising,
slowly-developed and precocious, misanthropists and
men of pleasure, the morose and the cheerful. In short, we
can only conclude, at most, that they have a tendency to
depart from the average—whether to rise above it or fall
below it.</p>

<p class='c017'>According to the other theory, all this is secondary,
accessory, physical and psychical defects being by no means
a necessary condition of genius. It grows equally well on a
sound stem or a rotten one; it bears the marks of its origin,
but this is quite a matter of accident. There are also facts
in support of this view, though it must be acknowledged
that they are less numerous than those on the other side.</p>

<p class='c017'>We may also generalise the question, and ask whether
æsthetic activity is not always a deviation. Nordau has
maintained the affirmative: “Art is the slight beginning of
a deviation from complete health.” Thus presented, the
question is equivocal. If we understand by mental health
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ataraxia</i></span> of the ancient philosophers, it is clear that
creative and even æsthetic enjoyments are incompatible with
it. To demand that we shall create or enjoy without excitement,
remaining all the time in the level, prosaic calm
of every-day life, is to expect the impossible. On this
showing we might say as much of any emotion whatever
and allege it to be a deviation from health. Some intellectualists,
Kant among others, have ventured to make this claim,
which is as much as to say that man is, by nature, an
exclusively reasonable being—so enormous a psychological
error that we need not discuss it. Besides, even supposing
this to be the ideal, the mission of psychology is not to
study an ideal man, but the real one.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>After this somewhat lengthy preamble, rendered necessary
by the ambiguity of our subject, let us investigate the
part played by the two essential factors, emotion and
imagination, when their activity is pathological, and in
clearly-defined cases.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. The necessity for vividness and sincerity of feeling in
the artist is so obvious that I need not insist on it. This
disposition, however, is not in all cases identical. Acute
emotion may be intermittent, appearing only at moments
of inspiration and creation, and then, the crisis over, disappearing
to let the emotional life take its normal course.
This is the characteristic of healthy genius or talent, which,
descending from the heights, returns and adapts itself to the
groove of ordinary life. A more frequent case, if we may
judge by biographical documents, especially as we approach
our own day, is the state of permanent excitement or hyper-excitability.
Artists and dilettanti are exceedingly delicate
instruments vibrating continually to every sound. Here our
triple criterion of pathological activity comes again into use:
we find (apparent) disproportion between cause and effect,
violent and prolonged shock to the system, chronicity.
This physiological state is one of continual loss; not a
combustion, but a series of explosions; not a life, but a
fever. Hence the craving for artificial excitement so frequent
in emotional natures of this kind; they seek it under
all its forms, and the remedy aggravates the evil. It is
needless to multiply examples, we need only recall the great
contingent of melancholiacs, hypochondriacs, alcoholics—persons
subject to hallucinations, insane, or merely <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>déséquilibrés</i></span>—furnished
by artists or passionate lovers of art.
Besides these general characteristics, we may note as
particular pathological symptoms of æsthetic emotion:</p>

<p class='c017'>1. An obstinate tendency to pessimism—the persistent
and exclusive taste for gloom in art predominating in
certain epochs of history, especially in our own. Its contagion
is not sufficiently explained by imitation and fashion;
it springs from deeper causes—from a general state of
depression, enervation, and debility. Art is the expression
of this secret uneasiness, both among those who create and
those who enjoy. This pessimism is not a disease of art,
but of the individual and the age, which can bring forth
no other fruit. We know that the nature of the ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>modifies the flowers of plants and gives to their fruits a
peculiar taste—the flavour of the soil; the human soil is
subject to the same necessity, and at certain stages of
civilisation it can produce nothing save a melancholy crop
of flowers with strange and acrid odour. The constant love
and complacent enjoyment of the mournful and morbid, of
all connected with death, is the æsthetic form of the <em>luxury
of pain</em> which I have already (Part I., chap. iv.) tried to
analyse, and to determine its pathological causes.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The tendency to megalomania under the form of pride,
and still more of excessive vanity. The remark on the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>genus irritabile vatum</i></span> is of old date; but at various epochs
the insanity of greatness has raged like an epidemic in the
domain of art. It has found its supreme expression in this
century in the doctrine of “the divinity of art” proclaimed
by the school of Schelling, and surviving among contemporary
“æsthetes.” “The beginning of all poetry,” said
Schlegel, “is to suspend the march and the laws of reason,
to plunge us once more into the beautiful maze of fantasy,
the primitive chaos of human nature. The good
pleasure of the poet suffers no law above him.” We have
gone still farther since then, and an interesting collection
might be made of the folly written on this subject. When,
sincerely and without prepossessions, we ask ourselves what
are the grounds of these high pretensions, of this apotheosis,
they are not very evident. Is it because art yields enjoyments
far superior to those of the senses? But scientific
research, and the love of travelling and exploration, do the
same thing. Is it because of its creative function? But
we find creation everywhere—in science, mechanic art,
politics, commerce, industry: artistic creation is only one
form among many others. Is it because it adds an ideal
world to the real? Religions do as much, with the
advantage that they do not work for the few, the elect,
but for the whole world. Malherbe used to say that a good
poet is no more useful to the State than a good skittle-player.
This is an extreme statement on the other side,
for the poet, after all, has a social value; he can foresee,
instruct, express the confused feelings of the mass of
human beings who arrive through him at the consciousness
of life.</p>

<p class='c017'>If, accepting this form of megalomania as a fact, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>discussing its legitimacy, we seek for its psychological
causes, we shall find two principal ones.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first is in the character of the individual, the hypertrophy
of his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego</i></span>. The self-feeling breaks out under an
æsthetic mask, as it might do under any other. “Egotist”
art is the sincerest expression of this impulse of pride (be
it noted in passing that it is the very antipodes of primitive
art, which is collective, social, anonymous); but it is an
ephemeral form destined to die of inanition. Besides, its
expansive force would be, if necessary, limited by the expansion
of rival individualities. The production of monsters is
a necessity of civilisation. By means of the division of
labour, it imposes, in all positions and occupations, an
excess of unilateral development, of tendency towards a
single aim; it requires specialisation. In primitive times,
art was not a profession; the artist, while all the time
going on with other work, produced naturally, spontaneously,
as a rose-tree gives its roses; it was a superabundance
of mental activity which thus found vent. Gradually he
fell into the professional track, and now, a victim to his own
glory, he is <em>forced</em> to produce, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nolens volens</i></span>, as he can,
consciously fabricating works of art as others do articles
of commerce, reckless of over-production. It is a hypertrophy
of the creative function.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second cause must be sought in a deeper region
than that of consciousness, in that unconscious part of us
(whatever opinion may be entertained as to its nature)
which produces what is vulgarly called inspiration. This
state is a positive fact accompanied by physical and
psychical characteristics peculiar to itself. First and foremost,
it is impersonal and involuntary; it acts like an
instinct, when and as it pleases, it may be solicited but
not compelled. Neither reflection nor will can supply
the place of original creation. We have numerous anecdotes
relating to the habits of poets, painters, and musicians
when composing: striding up and down, lying in bed,
seeking complete darkness or full daylight, keeping the
feet in water or ice, and the head in the sun, the use of
wine, of alcohol, of aromatic drinks, of haschisch or other
poisons acting on the intellect. Apart from some oddities
not easy to explain, all these proceedings have the same
object—viz., to bring about a particular physiological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>condition, and increase the cerebral circulation in order
to provoke or maintain the unconscious activity. The
ancients saw in inspiration a supernatural state, a divine
action, a possession in which they firmly believed. Certainly,
we now look on the Muses, and the various mythological
gods of music and poetry, merely as superannuated fictions;
yet there remains an impression of mystery, of a superior
power, of a rare inborn gift bestowed on a man, which is
his special privilege, which acts through him and is
unknown to others, something analogous to what we have
already met with in the case of theomania. From the
vague consciousness of this state of election, this exceptional
favour on the part of nature, it is for the artist an easy step
to the affirmation of his greatness.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. The pathology of the creative imagination does not
belong to our subject; it is only connected with it through
the influence of feeling on its operations. The power of
constructing an imaginary world is a human attribute of
which no one is devoid, since without it we could never
take one step out of the present into the future and form
for ourselves an image, however inadequate, of the latter.
Observation shows that, from this universal level upward,
there are all gradations, from the dry, clear, coherent
imagination to incoherent, impalpable reverie and disordered
exuberance: now, the increasing predominance
of the imagination involves the danger of living entirely
in the world of the unreal, which frequently happens.
Biographical documents permit us to note the stages in
this ascent towards the suprasensible.</p>

<p class='c017'>There are artists who divide their lives into two parts
and keep them distinct; they keep their accounts in double
entry; they have their hours of unbridled imagination, and
their hours of practical good sense. Ariosto was one of
these; it was said of him that he had put his folly into his
books and his wisdom into his life.</p>

<p class='c017'>Others are, for the moment, caught by their own creations,
and so violently carried away by them that they are near the
state of hallucination. According to the constitution of their
minds, they either see their characters or hear them speak; the
sounds are in their ears, they breathe odours, taste flavours.
On this last point, Flaubert’s declaration, reported by Taine
has been doubted, but without sufficient reason.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>There are some who appear to be in an almost continuous
state of hallucination. Such seems to have been the case
of Torquato Tasso. “At certain moments,” Gérard de
Nerval used to say, “everything would assume a new
aspect to me: secret voices rose from plants, trees,
animals, to warn and encourage me. Formless and lifeless
objects had mysterious ways, whose meaning I understood.”
The “symbolists” of various countries—French,
Belgian, English—are now telling us the same thing with
more to the like effect. I do not think, however, that we
can be deceived by them. They are returning, through
a sharpened and refined sympathy, to the primitive period
of naïf animism, in which everything in nature has life,
sight and voice, in which, as one of them says, the real
world assumes the air of fairyland.</p>

<p class='c017'>Beyond this there is only one step, that of complete and
permanent hallucination, such as is to be found in lunatic
asylums; the total substitution of an imaginary world for
the real, without intermission, doubt, or consciousness of
unreality.</p>

<p class='c017'>This is the clearest part of the subject, but there is one
obscure point which must detain us, the more that it is
connected with the fundamental phenomenon of emotional
life: <em>tendency</em>. If there is one psychological law more firmly
established than another, both by facts and argument,
it is that every intense representation of an act tends
to realise itself; which is inevitable, since the vivid image
of a movement is the beginning of a movement—a revival
of motor elements included in the image. A man
who, standing on the top of a tower, is fascinated by the
idea of a possible fall, runs the risk of throwing himself
over; the attraction of the abyss is nothing else but this.
On the other hand, artists naturally have intense representations
and feel things violently; they dream of orgies, love
adventures, sanguinary dramas, self-devotion, virtues and
vices of all sorts. How comes it that all this is merely
imagined, and never passes into action, or becomes a
reality?</p>

<p class='c017'>It is because in their case the law is subject, not to an
exception, but to a <em>deviation</em>. The intense representation
<em>must</em> be objectivised—<i>i.e.</i>, from being internal become
external, and it may arrive at this result in two ways:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>by a real action, as in the case of ordinary people, or by
the creation of a work of art which delivers one from
the haunting idea: this is the peculiarity of artists. If,
besides this, a physiological reason is required, it might be
admitted, merely as a hypothesis, that in these cases the
motor centres have not, usually, sufficient energy for
practical realisation, whence it comes that their satisfaction
is a purely æsthetic one.</p>

<p class='c017'>To keep strictly to our subject, we have a large body of
testimony to show that many have only been delivered from
their haunting ideas by creative production, as I have
already mentioned when treating of memory. It is fixed
in a poem, a novel, a drama, a symphony, on the earth,
or in stone; we may remember Michelangelo and the
sculptures of the Medici chapel, Schiller’s early manner
and the “Robbers.” Is not Byron, whose psychological
state has been so well analysed by Taine (born for action
and adventure, returning, perhaps, to his true vocation
when he went to die at Missolonghi), the poet of pirates, of
strange and doubtful enterprises? The reader will think it
needless for me to enumerate further instances.</p>

<p class='c017'>This rule, however, is not without exceptions. The law
which requires that the intense image shall be actualised is
always satisfied; but sometimes this happens in two ways,
artistically and practically, at once. Many have lived out
their dreams of love, orgies, adventures, violence, and have
produced a work of art besides; a double stream has flowed
from the same source. Some of the romantic school have
revived the aspect of past ages in their houses, their furniture,
their lives. Artistic sovereigns have been able to realise
their imaginations to the full: Nero, Hadrian, Ludwig II.
of Bavaria, and others.</p>

<p class='c017'>An Italian anthropologist, Ferrero, has pointed out,
with some justice, that, in spite of our complaints of the
pessimistic, satanic, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>macabre</i></span>, or neurotic character of contemporary
art, this evil is not without its accompanying
good; it is a safety-valve, an overflow channel. Morbid
art “is a defence against abnormal tendencies, which,
otherwise, would tend to transform themselves into action.”
Many content themselves with a literary, plastic, or musical
satisfaction. This seems to be indisputable. We may also
grant to this author that the suggestion of a work of art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>has not the power of direct suggestion, that of the actually
perceived fact, and that, so far, it is less dangerous. But as
it is more widely diffused and acts especially on subjects
predisposed to it, it may be questioned whether, in the
long run, the gain is serious.</p>

<p class='c017'>This is a sociological question which it would be out of
place to discuss here, and which, consequently, we may
dismiss with a bare reference. Our conclusion is that the
pathology of the æsthetic sentiment has no independent
existence. It is one among many forms of expression (of
which we have already pointed out several) of a morbid
predisposition which can only follow this track in a small
minority of persons—those possessed of the power of
creative imagination.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>This name stands for the emotional states—agreeable, disagreeable,
or mixed—which accompany the exercise of the
intellectual operations. Intellectual emotion may be connected
with images, ideas, reasoning, and the logical course
of thought; in a word, with all the forms of knowledge.
Except in some rare cases, which will be pointed out later
on, it scarcely ever rises beyond a medium tone, especially
in its higher manifestations.</p>

<p class='c017'>After having traced it to its origin, we shall have to follow
its evolution, which passes through three principal phases:
the first, utilitarian and practical; the second, disinterested
and scientific; in the third, which is much less frequent, it
attains the power and exclusiveness of a passion.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. This feeling, like all the others, depends on an instinct,
a tendency, a craving; it expresses in consciousness its
satisfaction or non-satisfaction. This primitive craving—the
craving for knowledge—under its instinctive form is called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>curiosity. It exists in all degrees, from the animal which
touches or smells an unknown object, to the all-examining,
all-embracing scrutiny of a Goethe; from puerile investigation
to the highest speculations; but whatever may be the
differences in its object, in its point of application, in its
intensity, it always remains identical with itself. Those
devoid of it, such as idiots, are eunuchs in the intellectual
order.</p>

<p class='c017'>Assuming this innate craving, how is it developed during
the first period?</p>

<p class='c017'>The first stage is that of <em>surprise</em>. It appears early in the
child; quite clearly, at latest, in the twenty-second week,
according to Preyer. It is a special emotional state which
cannot be traced back to any other, consisting of a shock,
a disadaptation. In my opinion, its special and peculiar
character lies in its being without contents, without object,
save a relation. Its material is a <em>relation</em>, a transition
between two states—a mere movement of the mind, and
nothing more. The mode of expression and the physiological
accompaniments of surprise are very clearly defined.
The description of these will be found in Darwin (<cite>Expression
of the Emotions</cite>, ch. xii.); the eyes and mouth are wide
open, the eyebrows raised, the sudden shock is followed by
immobility, the pulsations of the heart and the respiratory
movements are accelerated, etc.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second stage is that of <em>wonder</em>. I think with Bain
and Sully,<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c010'><sup>[229]</sup></a> that the distinction between these two stages is
not a vain subtlety. Surprise is momentary, wonder is
stable; one is a disadaptation, the other a readaptation;
one is without objective material, the other has for its
material some strange or unaccustomed object. It is this
second stage, no doubt, which Descartes called admiration,
and which he placed among his six primary passions:—"Admiration
is a sudden surprise of the soul which leads
it to consider with attention the objects which appear to it
rare and extraordinary."<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c010'><sup>[230]</sup></a> In fact, wonder is the awakening
of the attention, of which it has the principal characteristics—unity
of consciousness, convergence towards a single
object, intensity of perception or representation, adaptation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>of movements.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c010'><sup>[231]</sup></a> In the beginning, before wonder is accompanied
by pleasure (or pain, as the case may be), it has a
peculiar character approximating to what we have called the
neutral state, or that of simple excitation.</p>

<p class='c017'>The third stage is that of <em>interrogation</em>, of reflections
succeeding to the consternation produced by the first shock.
This is the stage of curiosity properly so called, which
consists in two questions, put implicitly and explicitly:
What is that? What is the use of it? What is the concrete
nature of this object? and what can be its utility? Primitive
peoples, children, animals, incessantly put to themselves this
double question; not, certainly, in clear and analytical terms,
but instinctively and by their actions. The dog, brought
face to face with an unknown object, looks at it, smells it,
approaches, withdraws, ventures to touch it, returns, and
begins again; he is pursuing this investigation after his own
fashion; he is solving a double problem of nature and
utility.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c010'><sup>[232]</sup></a> The interrogation consists in assimilating the new
object to our former perceptions or representations—classing
it, in fact.</p>

<p class='c017'>Is primitive man curious? Herbert Spencer alleges a
large number of facts in proof of his distaste for novelty.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c010'><sup>[233]</sup></a>
However, the craving for knowledge seems to be very
unequally distributed among the various races; the only
universal fact appearing to be that primitive curiosity is
limited to very simple things, all of which have, or seem to
have, some practical utility. Curiosity and the emotional
state which accompanies it have no other end than the
preservation of the individual—just as we have seen with
regard to the tendency to live in communities, or to revere
the gods, in this same initial period of evolution. To be
wide awake, to make inquiries as to what will help or harm
one, in a word, knowledge in the practical order, is a
powerful weapon in the struggle for life; a cause of selection
in favour of the curious, and at the expense of the incurious.
It is the survival of this entirely utilitarian curiosity which
explains why, at the present day, uncultured and even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>semi-civilised peoples object to the entrance into their
country of travellers from a distance for the purpose of
geological or other scientific explorations; they are always
suspicious of a search for treasure, of espionage, or of some
unknown ill deed on the part of the strangers.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. How did the transition to the disinterested period
come about? We may admit, with Sully,<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c010'><sup>[234]</sup></a> that this took
place through the natural, innate inclination of the human
intellect towards the extraordinary, the strange, the marvellous.
The same tendency which, under its creative form,
engenders religious, poetical, social myths, attempts under the
form of research to discover instead of imagining causes.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c010'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>We are here at the point of junction between the
æsthetic and the intellectual sentiments, which will presently
bifurcate, and pursue each its own course. This inquiry
is only half disinterested, however, for if man tries to
penetrate the mystery of things it is in the hope of
profiting thereby.</p>

<p class='c017'>For the rest, however this transition may have come
about, it took place when the struggle for existence became
less keen, and it was possible to cultivate disinterested
research for its own sake. Next, curiosity became scientific
emotion, and gradually extended itself to every kind of
investigation: the intellectual sentiment was formed in all
its fulness.</p>

<p class='c017'>It has been studied with a certain favour by psychologists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>especially those of the school of Herbart, or those who have
felt his influence, under the name of “feelings of relation,”
"feelings connected with the cause of representations." I
do not intend to follow them through their tedious and
uninstructive task of divisions, subdivisions, and distinctions
worthy of the schoolmen of the fourteenth century. Besides,
the alleged classification of the intellectual feelings varies
from one writer to another—one giving fifteen, another
sixty. It is an artificial method, a labyrinth, a source, not of
clearness, but of obscurity. I defy the subtlest psychologist
to note and fix the delicate gradations of feeling which, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ex
hypothesi</i></span>, should answer to this endless enumeration.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c010'><sup>[236]</sup></a> But
its most serious defect lies in its including only the intellectual
and not the emotional states.</p>

<p class='c017'>I can only admit one division, which has the advantage
of simplicity, and, more especially, of being based on the
very nature of the emotional process. This is, into the
pleasures and pains accompanying research or the acquisition
of knowledge, and those which are attached to its
possession, or the state of being without it. The former
are <em>dynamic</em>, the second <em>static</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>Intellectual emotion, under its <em>dynamic</em> form, depends
on the quantity of energy expended. In fact, it is only a
particular case of the emotional state accompanying every
form of activity directed towards an end compatible with
success or failure; it is only one form of self-feeling, differing
only in its object, not in its nature, from the feeling of
the explorer or the hunter. The search for knowledge is a
hunt like any other, truth being the game, and just as many
sportsmen find more charm in the vicissitudes of their
expedition than in their spoils, so many truth-seekers will
accept as their own, Lessing’s well-known saying: “If I were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>offered the choice between already ascertained truth and the
pleasure of finding it out, I would choose the second.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Under its <em>static</em> form, intellectual emotion is still a particular
case of self-feeling, whose principal manifestation is
the sense of power, or its opposite. It is one form of this
sense, by the same right as the pleasure of physical strength,
the pleasure of riches, or their opposites. It approximates
especially to the feeling inspired by possession or property;
it is felt, under its positive form as augmentation, under
its negative as diminution and poverty; ignorance is a
retrenchment, a limit.</p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up, intellectual emotion is simple enough; it is
only the transfer of the emotional manifestations already
known to us, to a group of mental operations. There is no
need, therefore, to insist further on the matter.</p>

<p class='c017'>III. We have still to follow it into a third stage, which it
rarely attains, because pure ideas have little attraction for
average human beings—viz., the cases in which it becomes
a <em>passion</em>. It is evident that the intellectual passion cannot
exist outside the dynamic group, possession being, in
the nature of things, a calm pleasure, or, as the ancients
said, a pleasure at rest.</p>

<p class='c017'>We might find numberless instances in the biographies
of scientific men and philosophers. Some names suggest
themselves at once: Kepler, Spinoza, and many others who
devoted their lives strictly and exclusively to the pursuit of
truth. It may be objected, however, that, in certain cases
and with certain men, nothing proves that the intellectual
passion has not been fed or sustained by foreign elements;
that the love of learning, though the principal motive, has
been the only one; that it has not been adulterated with
others—<i>e.g.</i>, desire for position, influence, riches, fame,
glory, in short, ambition under its manifold aspects. It is
not easy to find absolutely pure cases; for, besides the
rarity of the intellectual passion, the terms in which the
demand is framed are almost contradictory, since the men
we want to find must be unknown to fame. The following
instance, however, seems to me to answer perfectly to all
the conditions. Descuret, in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Médécine des Passions</cite></span>,
gives a brief biographical sketch of a Hungarian named
Mentelli, a philologist and mathematician, who, without a
definite end in view, simply for the pleasure of learning and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>to satisfy his intellectual cravings, consecrated his whole
life to study, having apparently no other want. “Living at
Paris, in a filthy lodging, the use of which was allowed him
out of charity, he had cut off from his expenditure all that
was not absolutely necessary to sustain life. His outlay—apart
from the purchase of books—amounted to seven sous
a day, three of which went for food and four for light; for
he worked twenty hours a day, without intermission, except
on one day in the week, when he gave lessons in mathematics,
on the fees received for which he subsisted. All he
needed was water, which he fetched for himself, potatoes
which he cooked over his lamp, oil to feed the latter, and
coarse brown bread. He slept in a large packing-case, into
which, during the day, he used to put his feet wrapped in a
blanket or a little hay. An old arm-chair, a table, a jug, a
tin pot, and a piece of tin roughly bent into a convex shape,
and serving as a lamp, formed the rest of his furniture.
Mentelli saved the price of washing by wearing no linen.
A soldier’s coat bought at the barracks and only replaced in
the last extremity, a pair of nankeen trousers, a fur cap, and
huge <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>sabots</i></span> composed his entire costume. In 1814 the
cannon-balls of the allies fell all round the lodging he was
then occupying, but failed to disturb him.... During the
first epidemic of cholera at Paris, it was necessary to employ
armed force to compel this scientific anchorite to interrupt
his studies, so as to clean out his pestilential cell. He lived
thus, uncomplainingly, and indeed happily, for thirty years,
without a day’s illness. At last (on December 22nd, 1836),
at the age of sixty, having gone as usual to fetch water from
the Seine, his foot slipped, he fell into the river, then in
flood, and was drowned. Mentelli left no work behind
him, in fact there remains no trace of his long researches.”<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c010'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Other instances might be quoted, but they would appear
trifling by comparison with this. Great anonymous collaborations,
like those of the Benedictines, have certainly
enlisted the services of enthusiasts of this kind; thus Dom
Mabillon was the type of a worker animated with passionate
fervour, modest, unknown, punctually fulfilling his religious
duties, and when free from these, travelling about the world
on foot to collect historical documents.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus we find cases where the love of knowledge alone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>untarnished by other motives, has all the characteristics of a
fixed and tenacious passion, filling the whole of life, and
expressing the whole nature of a man.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>The intellectual feeling also has its pathology, in connection
with which I have to point out two principal
cases: the extreme forms of doubt, and the introduction
of mysticism into science.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. Doubt is a state of unstable equilibrium in which
successive contradictory representations neither mutually
exclude nor conciliate each other. I distinguish simple
doubt, dramatic doubt, and the insanity of doubt.</p>

<p class='c017'>In simple or limited doubt, intellectual indecision has as
its emotional accompaniment a slight uneasiness, a state of
discomfort resulting from an unsatisfied desire, a tendency
which comes to nothing. Under this form doubt is normal,
legitimate, and even necessary; it becomes morbid when it
takes a chronic, permanent, and aggressive form, when it
produces a violent shock and a long reaction.</p>

<p class='c017'>This is the doubt which I call dramatic, because it is an
internal convulsion, a crisis which often lasts a long time
and repeats itself. It precedes great conversions and then
subsides, but sometimes lasts through life, as with Pascal.
There is nothing surprising in its violence, since it is, in the
intellectual order, the equivalent of an intense, incurable,
and hopeless love; in the two cases the situation and
effects are identical.</p>

<p class='c017'>The insanity of doubt takes us further into the intricacies
of pathology. It is “a chronic disease of the mind, characterised
by constant uneasiness.” It presents numerous
varieties, which have been classified by alienists. Some do
not pass beyond the region of every-day trivialities, as the
man who will return twenty times to see whether he has
really locked his door. Others exhaust themselves in
abstruse and insoluble questions, never able to satisfy
themselves or stop, like an ever-turning wheel. Others,
the timid, lose themselves in endless scruples and puerilities.
But, whatever be the matter to which the mind applies
itself, the psychological process remains the same. It is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>questioning without pause or limit, accompanied by distress,
constriction of the head, epigastric oppression, vaso-motor
troubles, etc. There is the ardent desire to find a fixed state
for thought without the ability to do so.</p>

<p class='c017'>Under its gravest form it is “the complete loss of all
notion and feeling of reality.” It is absolute scepticism,
not theoretic and speculative, after the manner of the
Pyrrhonians, but <em>practical</em>, bearing not only on ideas,
abstract conceptions, memories, reasonings, but even on
perceptions and actions; the exercise of the intellect is
not accompanied by any belief—<i>i.e.</i>, any state of mind
which presupposes a reality. “I exist,” says one of these
patients, “but outside real life and in despite of myself ...;
something which does not seem to be in my body
impels me to act as I formerly did, but I cannot succeed
in believing that my actions are real. I do everything
mechanically and unconsciously. My individuality has
completely disappeared; the way in which I see things
makes me incapable of realising them, of feeling that they
exist.... Even when I see and touch, the world appears
to me like a phantom, a gigantic hallucination.... I eat,
but it is a shadow of food entering the shadow of a stomach;
my pulse is only the shadow of a pulse.... I am perfectly
conscious of the absurdity of these ideas, but cannot overcome
them.”<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c010'><sup>[238]</sup></a> This state belongs, in fact, to the category
of conscious madness.</p>

<p class='c017'>But it is not essentially a disease of the understanding:
the intellectual element is secondary; this perpetual doubt,
these endless questionings are merely the effects; the cause
lies in a weakening of the emotional life and the will,
rendering them incapable of arriving at a belief—<i>i.e.</i>, an
affirmation—and, more deeply still, in a disturbance of the
organic life, as demonstrated by sensory perversions, motor
enfeeblement, and the melancholic state of the patient with
its physiological accompaniments, and lowering of the vital
functions.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The introduction of mysticism into science, though
particularly prevalent just now, is an intellectual disease
incident to all ages. In the beginning, scientific research
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>had no clear consciousness either of its method or its
object.</p>

<p class='c017'>The earliest Greek philosophers speculated at once on
first causes, second causes, and practical applications,
without drawing any hard and fast distinction between
these subjects. Thales constructed a cosmology and
calculated eclipses; Pythagoras reduced the universe to
numbers, but he also greatly advanced the study of
mathematics, and founded a communistic society on his
own principles. By slow degrees the proper domain of
science became recognised: the determination of second
causes, of natural laws. At the Renaissance, alchemy,
astrology, and the occult sciences were discredited, in spite
of their provisional services, and some positive discoveries
due to them. At present, the methods are fixed, in their
main lines; a fact which permits us to determine the
anomalies and deviations of the intellectual sentiment.</p>

<p class='c017'>How does it deviate from the normal track? It is
needless to remark that it is not by seeking the unknown,
since this is its fundamental task, for every day and for all
time. Is it by pursuing the unknowable? This view is
scarcely tenable, for how can we determine where the
unknowable begins? Let us admit, for the sake of argument,
and in order to simplify matters, that this word
covers the whole region of first causes, taken as inaccessible;
but, having eliminated these, only by an
arbitrary act can it be decided that this or that
thing is unknowable. The history of science supplies us
with proofs in abundance. To give but one example,
which is closely connected with psychology: one of the
greatest physiologists of the century, J. Müller, declared
that the time necessary for perceiving a sensation is not
measurable and can never be determined; this, however,
did not prevent Helmholtz from measuring it some years
later, and it is well known what successful experiments
have since been made in that direction.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is not so much in the object pursued as in the method
employed that the love of science may go astray. Scientific
mysticism consists in replacing regular methods by intuition
and divination; in expecting everything from an inward
revelation, a supernatural illumination; in substituting the
subjective for the objective, belief for demonstration and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>verification, individual for universal validity. True, it would
be a great mistake to assert that intuition and divination
have not played an important part in the discoveries of
scientists; they lie at the origin of nearly all, and there
is a certain point where the psychological conditions of
scientific and of artistic creation coincide; but no scientist
worthy of the name will confound the vision of a truth with
its demonstration. He does not allow it to rank as scientific
till he has furnished his proofs. Mysticism is the reintegration,
in science, of the love of the marvellous, and the illusory
desire of acting on nature without preliminary research, work,
or trouble.</p>

<p class='c017'>Intellectual emotion, therefore, has two principal morbid
forms: doubt, which, at the last extremity, ends in dissolution;
and mysticism, which is only a deviation, and whose
essence consists in substituting imagination for logical
methods.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c010'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up, the intellectual emotion moves between two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>poles: one, where it involves a confused knowledge and
plays a preponderant part under that instinctive form which
may be called <em>flair</em>, or intuition; the other, where it is only
the pale shadow of the exercise of abstract thought. Under
this last form it is the type to which all other emotions
approximate, when the affective element is impoverished—viz.,
moral emotion in rationalistic theorists (the Stoics,
Kant), æsthetic emotion in critics, and religious emotion in
metaphysicians and dogmatic theologians.</p>

<p class='c016'>Several writers have on various occasions pointed out,
with some reason, that the great analytical work carried on
in our day, in the domain of psychology, ought to be completed
by studies of a directly opposite character; <i>i.e.</i>,
analytic and abstract psychology has as its indispensable
complement a synthetic and concrete psychology. Like
every other science, ordinary psychology proceeds by means
of generalities. Whether it is concerned with percepts or
concepts, with the association of ideas or with movements,
with the attention or the emotions, it takes these manifestations,
wherever it finds them, in men or in animals, and
attempts to explain them by tracing them back to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>most general conditions. It starts with the implied assumption
that instincts, habits, intellectual, emotional, voluntary
phenomena are to be found in every man. But in what
proportions are these elements combined in order to constitute
the various psychological individualities? What
complex assemblages can they produce? Is there a preponderance
of emotion, intelligence, or action? Has the
preponderance of one any influence on the development of
the rest? These questions, and many other analogous
ones, are not put by analytical psychology, and justly so,
because they do not come within its province. Yet it is
worth while to put them, were it only for the sake of
practical utility.</p>

<p class='c017'>It has been said with regard to medicine that “there are
no diseases, only diseased persons.” This is why pathological
treatises, describing the general characteristics of
a disease in the abstract, are necessarily supplemented by
those clinical studies which describe concrete, particular
cases. In the same way, in psychology, it might be said
that there is no such thing as humanity, but only human
beings. It is not sufficient to describe the manifestations of
the mind in general, we must also take into account the
individuals in whom they are incarnated and the varieties
which they reveal to us. The synthetic point of view is
neither visionary nor negligible, and less so in psychology
than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c017'>A very widespread error consists in believing that when
we have resolved a complex whole into its elements we have
<em>all</em> the constituents. We are apt to forget that the greater
number of combinations resemble rather chemical <em>combinations</em>
than simple mixtures, that they are not formed by
simple addition, and that there is <em>more</em> in the synthesis than
there can be in the analysis.</p>

<p class='c017'>The elimination of the synthetic point of view becomes
less and less admissible as we rise from inorganic nature to
life, consciousness, society. Even in the inorganic world,
which contains only the general properties of matter in the
rough, certain composite bodies already show a sort of individuality—<i>i.e.</i>,
a way of acting and reacting peculiar to
themselves. This is best seen in crystals; their growth may
be interrupted and go on again; when broken or mutilated
they can repair their losses; they may undergo disaggregation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>or profound modification, but so long as one portion
remains unaltered it still has the power of growing and
escaping “senility.” Two totally different substances, even,
may be almost inextricably intertwined, while preserving
each its own individuality. In the world of life the cell
and the ovule have a very definite individuality; then come
aggregates of a vague, unstable, and precarious unity, such
as those of vegetables, hydrozoa, and those fixed or wandering
animal colonies which have been called federations;
but after passing through these stages of evolution, the
higher animal forms assert their individuality so decidedly
that argument is needless. The same may be said of
psychology. What has not been said of the unity and
utility of the <em>ego</em>, considered as a simple and indissoluble
entity? The present writer will not be suspected of an
inclination towards this view. Yet it must be acknowledged
that we have been so much occupied of late years with
disturbances, alterations, disaggregations, and dissolutions
of personality, that the triumph of the analytical method
has been complete, and the synthetic side of the subject
somewhat neglected.</p>

<p class='c017'>Without insisting on a question of too great extent to be
treated incidentally—viz., the opposition between analytic
and synthetic psychology,—we may say that there are two
equally legitimate ways of considering all things in nature:
the analytic, abstract manner, which recognises only laws,
genera, species, generalities; and the synthetic, concrete
manner, which sees only particular facts, events, individuals.
Each one presupposes and completes the other:
they are two stages of the same method.</p>

<p class='c017'>So far it is clear that, in the new psychology, the analytic
process has prevailed. In spite of these unfavourable conditions,
some valuable work has been done in the other
direction, the principal being the determination of certain
types of imagination, visual, auditory, motor, and other
varieties. But the chief problem proposed to synthetic
psychology is elsewhere, in the region of action, not of
knowledge. It is practical, and consists in determining the
principal types of individuality from the kind of action and
reaction which has its source in the feelings and the will.
This is called by a name slightly vague, but consecrated
by usage—character.</p>

  <h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c019'>The aim of the present chapter is not to treat this
difficult subject, but simply to attempt a classification of
characters, and to show their relations with affective
psychology.</p>

<p class='c017'>I shall pass by in silence the history of the question;
it would be long and monotonous. It seems to me that it
has developed in two directions, one especially physiological,
the other especially psychological.</p>

<p class='c017'>The physiological theory is very ancient, and was for
centuries the only one current. It is summed up in the
classical doctrine of the four temperaments, which dates
from the Greek physicians. These great observers had
deduced it from their long experience, adding, it is true,
chimerical hypotheses as to the predominance of the liquids
of the organism or the cosmic elements. Criticised,
defended, abandoned, taken up again, modified, increased
by Cabanis by the addition of the nervous and muscular
temperaments, reduced by others to three, it has remained
substantially the same up to the present day. Psychology
has been content with adapting this arrangement to its own
use, and translating the terms into its own language. For
the rest, this work was, so to speak, done in advance; for
the description of each temperament enumerates not merely
physical, but also psychical characteristics. The <em>sanguine</em>
is reputed to be light, versatile, superficial, accommodating;
the <em>melancholic</em>, deep, self-involved, hesitating; the <em>choleric</em>
has an active imagination, and intense, tenacious passions,
difficult to supplant; the <em>lymphatic</em> (or phlegmatic) is soft,
cold, with slow reactions and dull imagination. The
detailed description of these four types may be found
almost anywhere, so that I need not dwell on them. I
notice that, during the present century, it is mostly in
Germany that this psycho-physiological theory has been
dominant. Kant adopted and developed it (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Anthropologie</cite></span>,
Bk. III.). Lotze substitutes the term “sentimental” for
that of “melancholic,” as being less equivocal; while
Wundt, in his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Physiologische Psychologie</cite></span>, reproduces Kant’s
divisions almost unchanged.</p>

<p class='c017'>The psychological theory is more recent, and, I believe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>of English origin. We know that J. S. Mill demanded the
constitution of a science of character (“Ethology”) to be
deduced from the general laws of psychology. Bain seems
to have attempted a response to this appeal in his book
<cite>On the Study of Character</cite> (1861). This is not the place
to analyse his work. Half of it is devoted to a criticism
of the phrenologists, who also, in their way, were making
an examination of our subject without paying much
attention to the temperaments. It is only of importance
to note that Bain’s position is strictly, rigorously psychological;
he admits three fundamental types: the intellectual,
emotional, and volitional or energetic. More recently, M.
B. Perez<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c010'><sup>[241]</sup></a> has proposed a classification of characters, based
solely on an objective phenomenon—viz., the movements,
their rapidity and energy. He distinguishes, in the first
place, the lively, the slow, and the eager; further, as mixed
types, the lively-ardent (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>vifs-ardents</i></span>), the slow-ardent, and
the deliberate (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pondérés</i></span>). Paulhan traces back the law
explaining the formation of character to a more general law:
that of “systematic association—<i>i.e.</i>, the aptitude inherent
in every element, desire, idea, or image of exciting other
elements which may associate themselves with it in working
towards a common end.” He has given a very detailed
description of the numerous and varied forms to be met
with in ordinary life, illustrating it with a vast multitude
of instances. Fouillée makes a separate study of temperaments
and characters, and divides the latter into three
categories: the “sensitive,” the “intellectual,” and the
“voluntary,” with several subdivisions.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c010'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>If we now try to take up the question again at our own
risk, the first thing to be done is clearly to determine the
essential marks of a true individuality, a real character.
This will permit us to eliminate at once all that resembles it,
but is not: appearances, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>simulacra</i></span>, phantoms of individuality.</p>

<p class='c017'>In order to constitute a character, two conditions are
necessary and sufficient: unity and stability.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>Unity consists in a manner of acting and reacting which
is always consistent with itself. In a true individuality the
tendencies are convergent, or at least there is one which
subdues the others to itself. If we consider man as a
collection of instincts, cravings, and desires, they form,
here, a tightly fastened bundle acting in one direction only.</p>

<p class='c017'>Stability is merely unity continued in time. If it does
not last, this cohesion of the desires is of no value for the
determination of character. It must be maintained or
repeated, always the same in identical or analogous circumstances.
The special mark of a true character is, that it
shall make its appearance in childhood and last through
life. We know beforehand what it will or will not do in
decisive circumstances. All this is as much as to say that a
true character is <em>innate</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>This disposition might be found fault with as being too
ideal. In truth, invariable characters, all of a piece, are
rare enough; yet some exist, and it is the conscious or
sub-conscious notion of this type which influences our
judgment. There is an instinctive craving for this ideal
unity in our psychological, moral, æsthetic conception of
character. It does not please us to see a contradiction
between a man’s beliefs and his acts. We are annoyed if an
ascertained rascal should show a good side, or a very good
person some weakness. Yet what more frequent? On the
stage, or in a novel, undecided or contradictory characters
do not attract us. This is because individuality appears to
us as an organisation which must be governed by an inner
logic following inflexible laws. We are very ready to put
down to duplicity and hypocrisy what is often only a
conflict between incoherent tendencies; and it is not the
least important among the practical results of recent investigations
into personality to have shown that its unity is
merely ideal, and that, without going the length of mental
dissolution and madness, it may be full of unreconciled
contradictions.</p>

<p class='c017'>These reserves being made, our definition of character
has the advantage of supplying us with a criterion which
remarkably simplifies our task; for it is clear that, among
the innumerable individuals of the human species, there
must be some, and these by far the greater number, who
have neither unity nor stability nor personal characteristics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>peculiar to themselves. This immense number of defective
cases, which are ruled out of our study, may be divided
into two categories—the <em>amorphous</em> and the <em>unstable</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>The <em>amorphous</em> are legion. I understand, by this term,
those who have no special form of their own, the acquired
characters. In these there is nothing innate, nothing
resembling a vocation; nature has made them plastic to
excess. They are entirely the product of circumstances,
of their environment, of the education they have received
from men and things. Some other person, or, failing that,
the social environment, wills for them, and acts through
them. They are not voices, but echoes. They are this
or that, according to circumstances. Chance decides on
their occupation, their marriage, and other things; once
caught in the machinery of life, they act like every one
else. They represent, not an individual, but a specific,
professional character; they are copies, to an unlimited
number, of an original which once existed. It has been
said that the production of amorphous people is the speciality
of civilisation, to which we owe their present abundance.
This is only half true. It is certain that excessive
culture rubs down the angles of character, and that, by
raising some and lowering others, it tends to a general
dead level. But we must not forget that, at the other
extreme of social life, in the savage state, where the
manners, customs, ritual, traditions of the tribe or clan,
which can neither be discussed nor infringed, weigh
heavily on each individual, where every innovation is
rejected with horror (this is what Lombroso calls misoneism),
the conditions are also very unfavourable to
individual development. It seems, if we may judge from
history, as if the period best suited for the growth of true
characters were the half-civilised ages, such as the first
centuries of the Roman Republic and of the Middle Ages,
or epochs of disturbance like the Italian Renaissance,
and, in general, all periods of revolution.</p>

<p class='c017'>The <em>unstable</em> are the <em>disjecta</em> and scoriæ of civilisation,
which may justly be accused of multiplying them. They
are the complete antithesis of our definition, having neither
unity nor permanence. Capricious, changing from instant to
instant, by turns inert and explosive, uncertain and disproportionate
in their reactions, acting in the same manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>under different circumstances, and varying their actions in
the same circumstances, they are indefiniteness itself. These
are, in different degrees, morbid forms, expressing the inability
of tendencies and desires to attain cohesion, convergence,
unity. We shall return to these in the next chapter.</p>

<p class='c017'>These two categories being excluded, the first because
they are simply a product of their environment, and the
second as being only an incoherent bundle of almost impersonal
impulses, there remain the self-existent characters,
which we must attempt to classify. Like every good
classification, this must be systematically conducted—<i>i.e.</i>,
descending, step by step, from the general to the particular.
It must determine genera, species, varieties, and thus, at
last, reach the individual. The principal defect in the
doctrine of the four temperaments (adapted to psychology,
as we have already seen) is that of being too general: it remains,
as it were, suspended in air, without intermediary,
without middle term, or anything to connect it with
the individual. It states the genera, nothing more. For
the rest, some writers appear to have perceived this lacuna,
having described mixed temperaments, but they are far from
being agreed as to the nature and number of the latter.</p>

<p class='c017'>The attempt at classification I am about to make includes
four degrees of increasing definiteness and diminishing
generality. On the first stage, we have the most
general conditions, a mere framework, almost empty, and
not corresponding to any concrete reality, but analogous
to the zoological and botanical genera. In the second
degree (corresponding to species), we have the fundamental
types of character, pure forms, but real, this time, and,
later on, justified and verified by observation. In the
third degree, the mixed or composite forms (corresponding
to varieties) are less clearly defined than the preceding.
In the fourth degree, we have those substitutes or equivalents
for character (they might also be called <em>partial</em>
characters) which depart more and more widely from the
pure type, but, in many people, take its place.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>We may begin by laying down the most general conditions
for the determination of character, the main guiding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>lines, the dominant traits which impress on it a clear and
decisive mark.</p>

<p class='c017'>As the psychic life, considered from the most general point
of view, can be reduced to two fundamental manifestations:
feeling and acting, we have in the first place, broadly speaking,
distinguished two types: the sensitive and the active.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The <em>sensitive</em>, who might also be called the affective
or emotional, have as their special characteristic the exclusive
predominance of sensibility. Impressionable to excess,
they are like instruments in a perpetual state of vibration,
and their life is for the most part inward. The physiological
bases of this type of character are not easy to enumerate;
but if we admit what seems to me incontestable—viz., that
the internal organic sensations of vegetative life are the
principal source of the affective development, as external
sensations are the source of the intellectual development,—we
must admit also that here the balance inclines in favour
of the first. It may be known by the extreme susceptibility
of the nervous system to agreeable or disagreeable impressions.
In general, this type may be said especially to include
the pessimists; for experience as old as the world itself
proves that sensitive subjects suffer more from a small misfortune
than they enjoy a great happiness. Uneasy, timid,
fearful, meditative, contemplative, such are the very vague
terms in which they may be for the moment characterised,
without passing beyond the region of generalities.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The <em>active</em> have as their dominant characteristic a
natural and continually renewed tendency to action. They
are like machines always in motion, and their life is mostly
directed outwards. The physiological basis of this type of
character consists in a rich fund of energy, a superabundance
of life,—what Bain calls spontaneity,—which is very
different from the intermittent and explosive reaction of the
unstable, and which, in the end, amounts to a good state of
nutrition. Taken in mass, and under their pure form, they
are optimists, because they feel strong enough to struggle
with obstacles and overcome them, and take pleasure in the
struggle. Gay, enterprising, bold, daring, rash—such words
describe their principal characteristics.</p>

<p class='c017'>H. Schneider, in an interesting article on zoological
psychology,<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c010'><sup>[243]</sup></a> has attempted to show that all special movements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>in the higher animals are only differentiations of two
simple, primary movements: contraction and expansion.
The tendency to contraction is the source of all impulses
and reactions, including flight, by which the animal acts in
a manner tending towards its own preservation. The tendency
to expansion shows itself in impulses and instincts of
an aggressive form: feeding, fighting, seizing on a female,
etc. The antithesis between the sensitive and the active
connects itself also with this fundamental contrast between
contraction and expansion, between the tendency towards
the inward life in some and that towards the outward life in
others.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The above classification is not sufficient. No doubt,
if we confine ourselves to theory, there is nothing to be
taken into account beyond feeling and acting; but observation
teaches us that it is necessary to form a third class,
that of the <em>apathetic</em>, corresponding, on the whole, to the
lymphatic temperament of physiology. Its general characteristics
are very well defined; they consist in a state of
<em>atony</em>—a lowering of the powers of feeling and acting
beneath the ordinary level. The two other classes are
positive; this is negative, but very real. The apathetic
characters must not be confounded with the amorphous,
the first being innate and the second acquired: the special
mark of the pure type of apathetic is <em>inertia</em>. He is not
plastic, like the amorphous type: there is no hold over
him. He cannot feel enough to induce him to act. He is
neither an optimist nor a pessimist, but indifferent. Idle,
sluggish, inert, careless: such are the epithets which usually
describe him. The physiological basis of his character is
the often-described lymphatic constitution—lowering of the
nervous tension, increase of the lymphatic circulation according
to some, weakening of the circulation of the blood according
to others. However, we must not conclude that it is
only a barren soil, on which nothing will grow. Add a
third element,—which till now we have purposely refrained
from mentioning,—intelligence, and the apathetic character
assumes an individuality, as we shall see presently.</p>

<p class='c017'>In this definition of the genera, of the fundamental types
reduced to their most general form, are we to admit a fourth
type—the <em>temperate</em>? We might say that when we have
(<i>a</i>) predominance of feeling, (<i>b</i>) predominance of action,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>(<i>c</i>) apathy in the absence of both the foregoing, there is
required, as a complement, a fourth state of perfect equilibrium
between sensibility and action. This type exists,
but I cannot admit that it should be included in a primary
definition. It is a mixed, composite form, whose study
is consequently out of place here. Besides, we must not
allow ourselves any illusions; every character is hypertrophied
or atrophied; the “perfectly balanced” character
is an ideal analogous to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>temperamentum temperatum</i></span> of
physiologists; or else it approaches the amorphous.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Leaving this very general classification, let us enter upon
our definition of the second degree. Let us pass from
genera to species. Here there enters on the scene a new
factor: the intellectual dispositions.</p>

<p class='c017'>The term <em>feeling</em> is applied to two distinct groups of
psychic manifestations, originally confounded—the affective
and the representative states. So far, in employing this
term we have taken account of the affective states only,
because they and the movements are the sole primary constituents
of character. They form the lower stratum, which
is the first to make its appearance: the intellectual dispositions
form a second layer, superimposed on the first.
What is fundamental in the character is the instincts, tendencies,
impulses, desires, and feelings; all these, and nothing
else. This fact is so easily verified, and so obvious, that
there would be no need to insist on it if the majority
of psychologists had not confused the question by their
incurable intellectualist prejudices—<i>i.e.</i>, by their efforts to
connect everything with intelligence and explain everything
by means of it, to lay it down as the irreducible type
of mental life. This view is quite untenable, for just as,
physiologically, the vegetative life precedes the animal life
based on it, so, psychologically, the affective precedes
the intellectual life, which is based on it. The groundwork
of every animal is “appetite” in Spinoza’s sense,
“will” in Schopenhauer’s—<i>i.e.</i>, feeling and acting, not
thinking. I do not wish to insist on this point, which
would require to be developed at great length; I forbear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>not on account of the scarcity, but of the superabundance
of proof.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c010'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Let us confine ourselves to some decisive remarks
which belong, in the strictest sense, to our subject. As
the character expresses the inmost qualities of the individual,
it can only be composed of essentially subjective
elements, and these must not be sought among the intellectual
qualities, since the intellect, in the ascending evolution
from sensations to perceptions, images, concepts, tends
more and more towards the impersonal.</p>

<p class='c017'>We might in addition prove, by means of numerous
examples, that the excessive development of the intelligence
frequently involves atrophy of the character, clearly
establishing their independence. The great manipulators of
abstractions, confined to pure speculation, tend to reduce
their ordinary life to a monotonous routine, whence emotion,
passion, the unforeseen in action, are as far as possible
excluded (Kant, Newton, Gauss, and many others).
Schopenhauer was right in saying that many men of genius
are “monsters by excess,” <i>i.e.</i>, by hypertrophy of the
intellectual faculties. “If normal man,” he says, “is made
up of two-thirds will and one-third intellect, the man of
genius consists of two-thirds intellect and one-third will.”<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c010'><sup>[245]</sup></a>
There are exceptions, as we all know. They prove, not
that the development of the intellect favours that of the
character, but that <em>in some cases</em> it does not fetter it. Is it
not also a matter of common observation that these two
factors, character and intellect, are often discordant? Men
think in one way and act in another; they write sublime
treatises on a morality which they do not practise; they
preach action and remain inactive; they have the tenderest
hearts in the world, and dream of plans for universal
destruction.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c010'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Intellect, then, is not a fundamental constituent of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>character; it is its light, but not its life, nor, consequently,
its action. The character sends its roots down into the
unconscious—<i>i.e.</i>, into the individual organism: this is
what makes it so difficult to penetrate and modify. The
intellectual dispositions can only exercise an <em>indirect</em> action
in its constitution. We have now to see by what mechanism
they do so.</p>

<p class='c017'>We know that the various emotions (fear, anger, love,
contempt, etc.) show themselves in certain spontaneous
movements and attitudes of the body, which constitute
their natural expression. Emotion is the cause; the movements
are the effect. It is less generally known that
movements and attitudes of the body, artificially produced,
are capable (in some cases, and to a slighter degree) of
exciting the corresponding emotions. Remain for some
time in an attitude of sadness, and you will feel sad. By
mingling in cheerful society and regulating your outward
behaviour in accordance with it, you may awaken in yourself
a transient gaiety. If the arm of a hypnotised subject
is placed, with clenched fist, in a threatening attitude, the
corresponding impression spontaneously appears in the
face and in the rest of the body; the same holds good
for the expressions of love, prayer, contempt, etc. Here
the movement is the cause and the emotion the effect.
The two cases are reducible to a single formula. There is
an indissoluble association between a given movement and
a given feeling. Emotion excites movements, movements
excite emotion; but with this very important difference:
that movements are not always capable of exciting emotion,
and when they do succeed, the states they bring about are
neither intense nor permanent. In a word, the action from
without inwards is always inferior to the action from within
outwards.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is exactly the same psychological law which governs
the relations between the affective and the intellectual
dispositions in the manifestations of the character.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let us (merely in a metaphorical way, and for the sake
of making the matter clear) call the action of the feelings
on the ideas, action from below upwards, and that
of the ideas on the feelings, action from above downwards.</p>

<p class='c017'>The action from below upwards is solid, tenacious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>energetic, efficacious; it has its strength within itself,
drawing it from the region of the unconscious—<i>i.e.</i>, from
the organisation. When it reaches the consciousness, it
merely becomes sensible. Thus what is at first a vague sense
of discomfort, asserts itself in the consciousness as hunger,
and may lead to theft, murder, and all sorts of excesses.
Another state of the organism shows itself in floating,
indeterminate desires, then asserts itself as love for some
particular being, and may in the end break out like a
thunderstorm. It would be superfluous to review in like
manner the whole of the passions, making the same
comments. Whether simple or complex, their evolution is
the same. The moral, religious, or æsthetic vocations
have their periods of incubation, of revelation, and of
action. The saying of Correggio, on looking at the
painting of a master, whether true or false historically, is
psychologically true.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the other hand, the action from above downwards
is unstable, vacillating, variable, weak, and of doubtful
efficacy. It has only a borrowed, extrinsic force. The
psychological (and often pedagogic) problem stated is the
following: How to bring about intellectual states, ideal
images, so that they may, if they can, provoke, by way of
reaction, the corresponding feelings. The action is mediate,
indirect, and usually fails or shows very poor results. The
sensibility produced is entirely intellectual; and who does
not know that intellectual passions are mere phantoms,
which a real passion sweeps away like a gust of wind?</p>

<p class='c017'>In conclusion, the action of the emotions on the movements
resembles that of the feelings on the ideas; the action
of the movements on the emotions is like that of the ideas
on the feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'>Having thus briefly established the secondary and superficial
part played by the intellect in the formation of
character, let us return to our classification. We are now
face to face with real individuals, unequally endowed with
energy, sensibility, and intelligence. Let us now take
our three great skeleton divisions, and fill them up, one
by one.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. <i>The Sensitive.</i>—In this genus I distinguish three
principal species, which I am about to describe, taking
the simplest first, and consequently departing more and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>more from the pure type as we approach the mixed
characters.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The first species cannot be designated by any proper
name; it is that of the <em>humble</em>. Excessive sensibility,
limited or moderate intelligence, no energy—such are
their constituent elements. Every one knows such persons,
for they are frequently met with. Their dominant note is
timidity, fear, and all paralysing modes of feeling. Like
La Fontaine’s hare, they live in perpetual uneasiness.
They are afraid for themselves, for their families, for their
small position or business, for the present, for the future.
They worry themselves about everybody’s opinion, even
that of unknown passers-by. They tremble for their
salvation in the other life, and in this they feel their
own nothingness, and the weight of the social organism
pressing upon them, which, in most cases, they cannot
understand. The smallest misadventure gives them a severe
shock, because they are conscious of being weak, and
without springs of action or the spirit of initiative.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is no one who cannot affix one or more names to
this portrait; but I need mention none in particular, just
because they are humble. I have eliminated all pathological
cases from this study; but I may point out, by way
of illustration, that many hypochondriacs belong to this
type, and show it in an exaggerated form.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The second species is that of the <em>contemplative</em>,
distinguished from the preceding by a much higher
intellectual development, so that their constituent elements
may be enumerated in the following order: acute sensibility,
sharp and penetrating intellect, no activity.</p>

<p class='c017'>A tolerably large number of varieties may be grouped
under this heading; they all resemble one another by
having the above three marks in common:</p>

<p class='c017'>The irresolute, like Hamlet, who feel and think deeply,
but cannot pass to action.</p>

<p class='c017'>Certain mystics, not the great ones, who have acted, and
whom we shall find later on, but pure adepts of the Inner
Life, such as may be found in all ages and countries—Hindu
Yogis, Persian Sufis, Therapeutæ, monks of all
creeds—plunged in the beatific vision, writing nothing and
founding nothing, and, always in pursuit of their dream,
passing through life without leaving a trace behind them.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>The analysts, in the purely subjective sense—<i>i.e.</i>, those
who assiduously and minutely analyse themselves, who keep
diaries, noting down from hour to hour the small changes of
their inner life, the variations of their feelings according to
the prevalent atmospheric influences. Such were Maine de
Biran among psychologists and Alfieri among poets. For
the rest, it is needless to mention particular names, since
this mania for personal analysis has, in recent times, under
the influence of excessive nervous excitement, of intellectual
refinement, and the enervation of the will, become a disease.
It should be noted that these sensitives are nearly all
pessimists.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. There still remains the third species, whom I shall
call the <em>emotional</em> type, though not in the wide sense in
which the word is used by Bain, who makes them into a
class. In this type, which abounds in great names, the
category of the sensitives attains its apogee. Activity is
here added to the extreme impressionability and the
intellectual subtlety of the contemplatives. But their
activity has its own special characteristic: it is intermittent
and sometimes spasmodic, because arising from an intense
emotion, not from a permanent reserve of energy. The
purely emotional character, says Bain, is inclined to
indolence. Nothing can be juster, under an appearance
of paradox. He only acts under the momentary influence
of powerful motives, then he falls back into the inaction
which is his essential nature; he alternates between impetuous
energy and sudden collapse.</p>

<p class='c017'>To this group belong many great artists: poets, musicians,
and painters, capable of feverish activity when sustained by
inspiration—<i>i.e.</i>, by an unconscious impulse; then undergoing
periods of exhaustion and impotence. We may cite,
at random, Jean Paul Richter, Mozart, Rousseau. This
last, as has frequently been demonstrated, should be
regarded as a pathological case. The same may be said
of certain orators, those who have “temperament.” It is
only on certain occasions that they put forth their full
power, when there is a cause, in which their feelings are
deeply engaged, to be defended, or enemies to be overthrown.</p>

<p class='c017'>II. <i>The Active.</i>—I divide this type into two species,
according as the intellect is mediocre or powerful.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>1. The species of the <em>mediocre active</em> shows us more
clearly the distinctive traits of this form of character and
the points in which it differs from the <em>sensitive</em>. “The
active man does his work better [than the sensitive]
because he can do the uninteresting drudgery, while the
other neglects whatever has not an intense and sustaining
interest. One man can take a walk without any object in
view more engrossing than the prospective warding off of
ill-health; the other cannot move abroad without a gun, or
a fishing-rod, a companion or something to see.”<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c010'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>The <em>active</em> are strongly constructed machines, well
supplied with vital force, and still more with potential
energy. Look at a small shopkeeper belonging to this
type, a man without talent or education; he wears himself
out in continual goings and comings, in offers of service,
in talk without end or cessation. It is not the love of
gain alone which impels him, it is his very nature, he
<em>must</em> be active. Put a sensitive in his place, he will do
nothing but what is absolutely necessary, or what interests
him. To this first group belong all those who have an
abundant supply of physical energy and need an outlet
for it: sportsmen, those who love an adventurous life
without other aim than action, globe-trotters, who hurry
about the world as fast as steam will take them, not for
the sake of business or of acquiring knowledge, making
no attempt to study the countries they pass through,
either at the time, or before, or afterwards, hurrying to
the end of their journeys in order to begin again. We
may add those fighters who are actuated by no resentment
or ill-feeling, but are merely letting off their
superfluous energy. The mercenary armies of former times
must have been recruited almost entirely among men of
this type.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. Let us now take the ordinary <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>condottiere</i></span>, such as the
Italian republics had in their pay by the thousand, fine
types of physical energy and mindless activity. On this
robust stock, graft an intellect, powerful, penetrating,
supple, refined, unscrupulous, thoroughly skilled in diplomacy,
and the ordinary <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>condottiere</i></span> becomes Cæsar Borgia,
and we pass from the lower to the higher form of the active
character.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>The latter, the <em>great active</em> types, abound in history, and
play prominent parts in it. Unhappily, the line of separation
between these and the mixed forms which we shall
encounter later on is so vague that I hesitate to name any
individuals. Julius Cæsar seems to belong to this pure
type; Lucan’s line <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nil actum reputans si quid superesse
agendum</i></span>, is the complete formula for the active. Nothing
either in his life or his style indicates an acute sensibility,
unless we reckon certain well-known passions, and his
epileptic fits, which, however, prove nothing. We may
also cite the Conquistadores of the sixteenth century (Cortez,
Pizarro), those Spanish captains whose expeditions read like
romances, who, with a handful of men as daring as themselves,
overthrew the great empires of Mexico and Peru,
and appeared to the vanquished as gods.</p>

<p class='c017'>III. <i>The Apathetic</i> (lymphatic, or phlegmatic, in the
ordinary classification of the temperaments).—I use this
word in the etymological sense, to denote, not a complete
absence of feeling, which is impossible, but a slight degree
of excitability and consequently of reaction. We should
be disposed to think, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>, that this type of character
never rises above mediocrity; experience, however, shows
the contrary. It is here that intellect is paramount. In
the silence of the passions, and the absence of physiological
activity, it finds a medium suitable for its development.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nowhere can we better see the influence of the intellectual
powers on the constitution of the character, and
the exact limits imposed on them by nature.</p>

<p class='c017'>In this class, too, I distinguish two species:</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The first is the pure apathetic type: slight sensibility,
slight activity, slight intelligence, a negative state. There
is little to add to what has been already said. They are at
once above and below the amorphous: above, because
they have their own special character, their indelible mark,
inertia, which the amorphous have not; and below, because
they meet external occurrences with a passive resistance.
They are only slightly influenced by education or suggestion,
not plastic, equally incapable of good and evil.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. With a powerful intellect, the case is quite different;
but we have to distinguish two cases, according as the
intellectual tendencies are speculative or practical.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first case is outside our subject. If a lymphatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>temperament coincides with a lofty speculative intellect,
which has occurred in a tolerably large number of mathematicians,
metaphysicians, and scholars generally, we have
to do with pure intellect only: these are Schopenhauer’s
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>monstra per excessum</i></span>, and I have nothing further to say of
their character.</p>

<p class='c017'>The second case, that of practical intellect, deserves
attention, because it shows us a very special form of character,
that which is the result of the action from above downwards,
of the influence of ideas on feelings and movements.
I call this group of characters the <em>calculators</em>. The ideas
give the first impulse, and thus we observe a lack of
spontaneity; the tendencies are only excited indirectly,
the will is not a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>laisser faire</i></span>, but an alternation of effort
and inhibition: of effort, because the motor power of
ideas is always very weak compared with that of desires;
of inhibition, not because there are any violent movements
to check, but because reflection is dominant and only
allows of action at proper times and places. These
characters might also be called <em>reasonable</em>, and they are
the work of art much more than of nature. If this
chapter were not exclusively devoted to individual
psychology, I should point out that this form of character
has been predominant among certain races, in certain
tribes, and at certain epochs.</p>

<p class='c017'>Benjamin Franklin is an excellent example: he is “the
great genius of prudential calculation.” In his letter to
Priestley entitled “Moral Algebra, or method of deciding
doubtful matters for one’s self,”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c010'><sup>[248]</sup></a> the reasons <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>
are entered opposite one another every day, after reflection
for a sufficient, frequently a long, period; they are then
compared, cancelled, balanced, and, this arithmetical
operation concluded, we proceed to action.</p>

<p class='c017'>Among the great names of history bearing this mark
we may mention William the Silent; Louis XI., who,
considering his epoch, was so devoid of the chivalrous
spirit; Philip II., who would not be interrupted in his
vespers by the news of the victory at Lepanto, and, shut
up in that cold bare room which is still to be seen at the
Escurial, concocted plots involving the fortunes of both
worlds.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>In more modest circumstances we may observe the same
character in cold-hearted speculators, tenacious of purpose,
who leave nothing to caprice, imagination, or chance—neither
uplifted by success nor dejected by reverses.</p>

<p class='c017'>To sum up: the three classes include great names. The
celebrated sensitives have acted through the intensity and
contagion of their feelings; the celebrated actives by the
force of their energy imposing itself upon others; the
great calculators by their power of reflection, which leaves
nothing to chance. They are strong, because wise; but
their glory is lustreless, unsympathetic, without prestige.
They are, however, <em>true</em> characters, because they have reactions
peculiar to themselves—coming from within, not from
without.</p>

<p class='c017'>IV.</p>

<p class='c017'>I cannot enter on my definition of the third degree without
some preliminary remarks. We pass from species to
varieties—from relatively simple to composite characters.
The doctrine of temperaments attempts a similar definition
when it undertakes the description of the mixed temperaments
(lymphatico-sanguine, nervous-sanguine, etc.), which
has given rise to many discussions. Instead of one dominant
characteristic—sensibility, energy, or reflection—we have
<em>two</em>, in juxtaposition and coexistent, sometimes in harmony,
sometimes in contradiction. We are departing from unity.
Those who, treating this subject as logicians, reason on
pure concepts, have said: There are states of being which
are mutually exclusive; we cannot, <i>e.g.</i>, be at the same time
apathetic and active; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ergo</i></span>, mixed forms must be rejected.
We need pay no attention to this: our business is to
observe, not to reason. Has experience established the
existence of mixed characters, whether contradictory or
not? This is the whole question. And it is not this point
which perplexes me, but the difficulty of finding clear, and,
above all, legitimate and incontestable differences between
the second and third degrees of definition—between the
species and the varieties of character. I have already
pointed out that the higher forms of the sensitive, active,
and apathetic types tend to shade away into the mixed
types.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Without undervaluing possible objections, I would propose
the following groups:—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The <em>sensitive-actives</em>. Nothing contradictory in this
form of character. An acute sensibility, without excess or
morbid hyperæsthesia, is easily reconciled with an active
and energetic temperament, because there is a natural connection
between feeling and acting. These characters result
from a synthesis of the sensitive and the active types, having
all the qualities not mutually exclusive found in both. In
short, as shown in its most brilliant representatives, it seems
to us one of the richest and most harmonious varieties of
character.</p>

<p class='c017'>I find it in its lowest degree in those who, without much
intellectual scope, live a life of pleasure, have a purely
egoistic craving for enjoyment and action. These specimens
of the sensitive-active character are without marked
features and have no originality; it would not always be
easy to distinguish them from the amorphous on the one
hand, or the unstable on the other.</p>

<p class='c017'>On a higher plane are the martyrs and enthusiastic heroes
who feel the need of action, of self-devotion, of sacrificing
themselves for their country or their faith: the great mystics,
founders or reformers of orders: St. Teresa, St. Francis of
Assisi; the great religious preachers: Peter the Hermit,
Luther; and men consumed by love for others, as St.
Vincent de Paul; in short, all those who may be called, in
the widest sense of the word, apostles.</p>

<p class='c017'>Further, we may include warriors like Alexander and
Napoleon; many great leaders of revolutions, like Danton;
such poets as Byron; and such artists as Benvenuto Cellini
and Michelangelo. I mention only well-known names, and
of these only just enough to make my meaning clear.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The <em>apathetic-active</em>. This variety closely approximates
to the species just described as “calculators.” It seems
to me, however, to be rendered more complex by the
addition of a certain quality of feeling or passion which
allows them to act, but rather defensively than offensively.
The dominant element is the idea which gives to this character
an unalterable fixity, and subjects their somewhat
weak sensibilities to its sovereign power. It is the “<em>moral
temperament</em>,” <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span>, but its morality is cold, has
been hardened by habit, and inspires respect rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>sympathy. The moral ideal which is the groundwork and
support of this form of character may be either true or false:
it varies according to time and place, consisting now of
public health, now of the general advantage, or belief in
some dogma, religious or other, or duty in the abstract, or
the categoric imperative. It is found among martyrs and
<em>passive</em> heroes, who do not run to meet danger, or challenge
tortures and death, but without enthusiasm, and equally
without fear or hesitation, do their duty to the end.</p>

<p class='c017'>Current language calls them stoics. We may add to
them cold-blooded fanatics of all sorts, the Jansenists and
others.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. The <em>apathetic-sensitive</em>. This is a contradictory synthesis,
which, nevertheless, exists. It must be recognised that
if “character” signifies an essential, fundamental, invariable
mark, this variety is not so much normal as semi-pathological.
I reduce it to the following formula: atony and
instability. We meet with people (this is not a fancy
portrait, but one taken from nature) of lymphatic temperament,
passing their days in inaction and torpor, who, flung
into action by some unforeseen circumstance, spend themselves
with as feverish an energy as the sensitives; but this
only happens by way of episode. A man of this sort, whom
I knew as leading a sedentary life and disliking locomotion
and change, suddenly started for Australia, fascinated by
some very hazardous project, and returned as quickly as
possible, vowing he would never do such a thing again.
The dominant note of this variety is apathy, though it
approximates to the unstable.</p>

<p class='c017'>4. If we admit the existence of the <em>temperate</em> character, it
ought to find its place here. Can we admit it, or ought it
not rather to be looked on as a purely ideal category?
Though we may admit that persons are actually to be
found in whom feeling, thought, and action are present in
strictly equal proportions, ought we not to consider this as
the absolute suppression of character, <i>i.e.</i>, of any marks of
individuality? Such perfect equilibrium belongs to a being
favoured by nature, and is a pledge of happiness, no doubt;
but the constitution of a character requires something other
than this. We might say that the <em>temperate</em> come under
our definition of character as complying with its two fundamental
conditions, unity and stability, and that they have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>system of action and reaction peculiar to them and consistent
with itself, so that it can be foreseen. But we
should need to know whether this initiative does not come
from circumstances rather than from themselves, and
whether their personality is not above all things an adaptation.</p>

<p class='c017'>I do not intend to dwell on an ambiguous problem,
which would become a mere debate about words. In any
case, it is a fugitive, indecisive form, without marked traits,
and bordering on the amorphous.</p>

<p class='c017'>I can find no names of mark to place under this heading.
Goethe has often been cited as a fine example of a balanced
character; but is he to be reckoned as a character or a
genius?</p>

<p class='c017'>V.</p>

<p class='c017'>Departing more and more from simple, clear, and definite
forms, we come at last to a group of what I have called the
<em>substitutes</em>, or equivalents for character. The shortest and
most suitable appellation for them seems to me to be “partial
characters.” Their formula is: amorphousness <em>plus</em> an
intellectual disposition, or a well-marked affective tendency.
The complete character expresses the whole individual; the
sensitive, active, and apathetic are respectively sensibility,
energy, apathy to the backbone; all their reactions, or
failures to react, show it. The partial character only acts on
one point; but on this one point the reaction is energetic,
invariable, consistent with itself, foreseen. In all other
ways, he thinks, feels, and acts like the rest of the world.
He is an imitator, a copy, an impersonal product of his
education and environment. This state of being takes the
place of a character in many persons, and many take it for
such.</p>

<p class='c017'>The partial characters resulting from intellectual aptitudes
are the simplest. If we suppose an innate aptitude for
mathematics, mechanical arts, music, painting, etc., it tends
to develop itself and to mask all the rest of the character,
to become the mark of the individual as a whole, and to
produce the illusion of a character which, after all, does
not exist, <i>i.e.</i>, is impersonal. Current speech applies to
this sort of hypertrophy an expression borrowed from the
phrenologists: “He has such or such a bump.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>Partial characters of an affective form consist in the
exclusive predominance of some one passion—<i>e.g.</i>, sexual
love, gambling, avarice, etc. Anything which excites this,
whether near or far off, causes an energetic and identical
reaction. Outside this ruling passion there is either slight
reaction, or indifference. It should be noted that this form
of partial character has not much stability, because it is in the
nature of passion to extend its influence, gradually to invade
the whole individual, and to bring about in him a pathological
transformation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lastly, as nature is fertile in combinations, and we
must try not to forget any, we find composite forms—<i>e.g.</i>,
an amorphous character <em>plus</em> an intellectual aptitude
and a passion.</p>

<p class='c017'>However incomplete, the classification just detailed may
have seemed over minute. I have no apologies to make for
this, my aim being to follow the natural method—viz., carefully
to distinguish the dominant from the subordinate
elements, to descend from the general to the particular
by an uninterrupted derivation, adding new characteristics
as we proceed. Is this a practical method? can it serve to
guide us amid the multitudinous manifestations of character?
If not, it ought to be rejected.</p>

<p class='c017'>What, at any rate, is apparent from this classification is
the diversity and heterogeneity of those individual modalities
which we designate under the collective name of character.
The unity of the word disguises the multiplicity of the
cases. This permits us to reply, in conclusion, to a very
important question frequently debated from the practical
point of view: Is character immutable?</p>

<p class='c017'>Two opposite answers have been given, both equally
sweeping.</p>

<p class='c017'>Some think that character is acquired, and, consequently,
indefinitely transformable by appropriate culture. This is
the theory of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tabula rasa</i></span> transferred from the region of
the sensations to that of the tendencies and feelings. It
was held by some of the eighteenth century philosophers,
and is implied in the views of all who have blind faith in
the omnipotence of education.</p>

<p class='c017'>Others look upon character as innate and immutable.
All acquired gradations are borrowed garments, or a
superficial and fragile coating which falls off at the least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>shock. With a vast superfluity of metaphysical distinctions,
Schopenhauer has maintained this view with much spirit
and vigour.</p>

<p class='c017'>The problem, therefore, seems to be reduced to this
dilemma: innate or acquired. I cannot, however, accept
it under this form; it is not so simple. Character is an
abstract entity—there exist only <em>characters</em>. For this
ambiguous term, which has only an abstract and factitious
unity, let us substitute the multitude of species and varieties
already described, and perhaps forgotten. Let us place at
one extreme the clear and definite forms which I have
called the pure types. Nothing modifies them, nothing
impairs them; good or bad, they are solid as the diamond.
At the other end of the scale let us place the amorphous,
who, by their very definition, are plasticity incarnate. Between
these two extremes we may arrange <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>seriatim</i></span> all
modes of character, so as to pass by imperceptible
gradations from one end to the other. It is clear that,
as we descend towards the amorphous, the individual
becomes less refractory to the influences of his environment,
and the proportion of acquired character increases
in the same ratio. This is equivalent to saying that <em>true</em>
characters never change.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>
  <h3 id='ch2.13' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br /> ABNORMAL AND MORBID CHARACTERS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Are all normal characters mutually equivalent?—Attempt at
classification according to their value—Marks of abnormal
character: absence of unity, impossibility of
prevision—Class I. Successive contradictory characters:
anomalies, conversions; their psychological mechanism.
Alternating characters—Second class: Contradictory
coexistent characters. Incomplete form: contradiction
between principles and tendencies. Complete form. Contradiction
between one tendency and another—Third
class: Unstable characters. Their physiological and
psychological characters—Psychological infantilism.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>In the works already quoted—those of Perez (1892),
Paulhan (1894), and Fouillée (1895)—and in the preceding
chapter, the various forms of character have been classified,
described, traced back to explanatory principles. In spite
of divergent interpretations and differences of nomenclature,
there are types universally accepted: the active, the sensitive,
the apathetic. But are they equivalent? Such is the
question put in the first instance when we pass from
normal to morbid characters. It seems to be implicitly
admitted that, each type having its qualities and defects,
its advantages and disadvantages, they ought to be placed
on the same level. The writer who confines himself to
classification and description may, by going no further,
avoid the difficulty. But as soon as we enter the region
of frankly morbid characters, we are led to ask, in the first
place, whether the characters reputed normal are all so in
the same degree, or whether some are not, by their very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>nature, nearer to pathological forms, and more apt to
undergo a retrogressive metamorphosis; in other words,
we have now to establish, not a classification, but a
hierarchy, a valuation often disputed, and difficult to fix.</p>

<p class='c017'>A Russian anthropologist, N. Seeland, is the only writer,
so far as I know, who has taken up the question from this
point of view. In fact, the ancient authors, when classifying
temperaments, and consequently characters, only divided
them into strong (the choleric and melancholic) and weak
(the sanguine and phlegmatic).</p>

<p class='c017'>This division (recently accepted by Wundt) is not at
bottom very clear, and might give rise to numerous
objections. Seeland has once for all broken with tradition
and abandoned the quadripartite division; he “does not
look upon all temperaments, as having the same value,
some approximating more to the idea of perfection, some
less.”<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c010'><sup>[249]</sup></a> His classification is, therefore, in fact a hierarchy;
and, beginning with the most perfect forms of character,
may be briefly stated as follows<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c010'><sup>[250]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c017'>I. The <em>strong</em> or <em>positive</em> temperaments, including—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The gay temperament, a type of which the classic
“sanguine” is only a variety; it comprehends three species:
(<i>a</i>) the strong sanguine, vegetative life predominant, reactions
rapid but appropriate, adapted to their end, without
agitation; (<i>b</i>) the weaker sanguine, resembling the preceding,
but with a mixture of the nervous type, the reactions
are less moderate and controlled; the French and the
Poles belong to this division; (<i>c</i>) the serene temperament
which stands midway between the strong sanguine and the
phlegmatic, uniting the advantages of both.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The <em>phlegmatic</em> or calm temperament never rises
above medium intensity, and presents a singular uniformity;
it is a mass whose movement can neither be accelerated
nor retarded: but calm does not exclude the possibility
of strength; on the contrary, it presupposes it. As nations,
the English, the Dutch, the Norwegians belong to this type.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>II. We descend a degree lower with the <em>medium</em> or
<em>neutral</em> temperament, “unknown to science, though that
of the majority of men.” It corresponds to the “balanced
natures” of Paulhan, and to those whom elsewhere we
call the amorphous, because they have no definite characteristic
peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p class='c017'>III. Lastly, we descend another step with the <em>weak</em> or
negative characters. “Their reaction may be quick or
slow, but what characterises them is the irregularity, the
superfluity, and even the perversity of their manifestations.
There are three varieties: (<i>a</i>) the pure melancholic,
distinguished by sadness and apathy, without nervous
symptoms, or at any rate, without dominant ones; (<i>b</i>) the
nervous, versatile, with alternations of normal activity, and
dejection, or excitement; (<i>c</i>) the choleric, which is not a
genus, is tolerably rare and distinguished by irascibility,
and may be combined with the melancholic or the weaker
sanguine; the serene and the phlegmatic are incompatible
with it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>In support of this classification follows a long anthropological
inquiry, drawn up in six tables. Its subjects were
160 men and 40 women belonging to the four principal
types, gay, phlegmatic, neutral, and melancholic. It includes
comparative statistics of stature, chest measurement, neck
and arm measurement, cubic capacity of the lungs, respiration,
pulse, temperature, dynamometric pressure, cephalic
indices, state of the senses, etc. The results are decidedly
favourable to the gay and unfavourable to the melancholic
temperament (see especially Table V., p. 114), the latter
being ascertained to have less strength and less delicate
senses, except as regards sensitiveness to pain. In women,
the nervous group, which takes the place of the melancholic
group in men, is the only one presenting any
anomalies.</p>

<p class='c017'>In his conclusions, this writer combats the “rooted
tendency to seek the essence of the temperaments in the
phenomena of the circulation and its satellite, the activity
of tissues.” Eight soldiers in good health, four of whom
belonged to the gay, and four to the melancholic type,
were kept by him on the same diet and carefully watched
for three days: the result of the analysis of weight,
secretions, and excretions “does not show that a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>rapid change of tissue took place in the case of the
sanguine than in that of the melancholic subjects.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Can so limited an experiment, and one of such short
duration, be called decisive?</p>

<p class='c017'>However that may be, rejecting the chemical theory,
Seeland prefers a physical explanation. In his view, “the
nervous tissue, besides its general activity, possesses an
elementary life which is the basis of temperament and
character.” Everything depends on the way in which the
nervous system responds to external or internal excitation.
The gay temperament would correspond to rapid and
harmonious molecular vibrations; the phlegmatic to vibrations
less rapid, but of imperturbable regularity; the
neutral to slow but constant vibrations, and the negative
forms to slow and discordant, or rapid and interrupted
vibrations.</p>

<p class='c017'>This arrangement in order of precedence is not free from
objection. I give it merely as an instance of a classification
according to the presumed value of characters, and as an
introduction to the study of the morbid forms which we
are about to commence.</p>

<p class='c017'>I</p>

<p class='c017'>In the first place, it is necessary to know by what signs
we can recognise whether a character deviates from the
normal types. Not to return to a subject already treated in
the preceding chapter, we may briefly say:</p>

<p class='c017'>1. A true character is reducible to one characteristic, one
preponderant tendency which ensures its unity and stability
throughout life. This conception is somewhat ideal, but
definite characters tend, in varying degrees, to approximate
thereto.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. In practice, a clearly defined character always (except
in rare cases, which explain themselves) permits us to foresee
and foretell. We know beforehand what an active,
a sensitive, a phlegmatic, or a contemplative will do
under given circumstances. Neutrals, who are, properly
speaking, not characters at all, are acted on by events or
by other people, and calculations as to their future must
start from a point, not within, but outside them.</p>

<p class='c017'>One, if not both of these marks, is wanting in abnormal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>characters, and the further they depart from these two constituent
conditions—unity and the possibility of foresight—the
further they depart from the typical forms, to become
at last unmistakably morbid.</p>

<p class='c017'>We might be tempted to believe that the anomalies of
character, as observed, are so varied in aspect, so manifold,
as to elude all classification, so that it is impossible to
find our way through the chaos. I think, however, that
the determining characteristics given above will supply us
with a clue. It is scarcely necessary to say that I exclude
from the group of anomalies those slight, temporary, and
intermittent deviations which are only passing infractions of
the unity of character. Cæsar, Richelieu, Napoleon were
well-defined types; yet, at certain points in their lives, they
ceased to be themselves. On his journey to Elba, in face
of the fury and the insults of the populace, Napoleon had
moments of strange timidity. Facts of this kind prove,
once more, that the complete character only exists as an
ideal; but an indisposition lasting a few hours cannot be
called an illness. Having made this reserve, we may, in our
classification, follow the retrogressive march from co-ordinate
unity to multiplicity, from stability to dissolution, and we
thus have three groups departing more and more widely
from the normal forms: (1) successive contradictory
characters; (2) simultaneous contradictory characters; (3)
unstable or polymorphic characters: the last stage of
disaggregation. It only remains to study them, one by
one, in their order.</p>

<p class='c017'>By <em>successive</em> contradictory characters, I understand two
opposite forms or manners of feeling and acting, so that the
life taken as a whole seems to be that of two individuals,
one preceding, the other following the crisis.</p>

<p class='c017'>Before dealing with the genuine cases, we must eliminate:</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The apparently contradictory characters abounding
in political history, such as the triumvir Octavius and
emperor Augustus. Cromwell, by turns an illuminated
mystic and a practical joker, retained, under these appearances,
the fundamental tendencies of an entirely practical
nature. So far from contradicting themselves and being unstable,
the character is single and homogeneous throughout:
there is perfect unity in the aims: it is only in the means that
contradiction appears. The moralist has a perfect right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>to call them false characters, because they wear masks; for
the psychologist they are quite normal and well marked.
They may frequently be met with in ordinary life, and
there one need not be an actor on a great stage to
appear to contradict one’s self; it is enough to be faithful
to the end in view and unscrupulous in the choice of means.
Those whom, in revolutionary times, fear makes suddenly
cruel belong to the same category; their unity lies in the
instinct of self-preservation.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The transformations produced by the evolution of
life and the change of circumstances. Thus an active
character may show itself successively in love, in
dangerous adventures, in ambition, and in the pursuit of
riches.</p>

<p class='c017'>Having got rid of doubtful cases, we may divide the
successive contradictory characters into two classes: the
first including anomalies, the second pathological forms.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. As, in our classification, we start from the normal state
and gradually leave it behind us, we must begin with the
modified forms which are simple deviations from the ideal
of the character—<i>i.e.</i>, from a constant and undisturbed
unity. Apart from all ideals, the successive characters are
exceptional with regard to the generality of people; for
even neutrals have throughout their lives a kind of unity,
that of their perpetual plasticity.</p>

<p class='c017'>In this first class I distinguish two cases. The reader
may find these divisions and subdivisions excessively
minute, yet they are necessary. There is no classification
without distinctions, and it is impossible to follow a retrogressive
order without marking every step on the way to
dissolution.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The simplest case, and the nearest to the normal
condition, consists in a change of direction in one and the
same predominant tendency in the individual. Such is the
case of Raymond Lulli, the change of the profane loves
which occupied the first part of his life into the platonic and
chivalrous love which filled the second; while the converse
case, too, is not rare, and examples might be found among
the mystics. Such are sincere conversions in religion or
in politics (St. Paul, Luther). The same may be said of
the cases where the fire of the temperament, having
previously expended itself for good, now does so for evil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>or conversely. All this, from the moralist’s point of view,
is a complete change—<i>i.e.</i>, there are two men; from the
psychologist’s, it is simply a change of direction, and there
is only one man. It is easy to see that, under the two
contrasts, there is a common foundation, a latent unity, the
same quantity or the same quality of energy directed to
different ends; but we can recognise the chrysalis in the
butterfly without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. These last are the modified forms; the clear cases,
which depart further from the rule, imply a fundamental
and genuine duality—<i>e.g.</i>, the passage from a life of orgies
to a <em>lasting</em> ascetic one (if it does not last, the change is
only a passing accident), from active to contemplative life
(Diocletian), from contemplative to active life (Julian the
Apostate); in short, all the cases where men burn what they
have worshipped and worship what they have burnt, where
we find two individuals in the same person. The common
language calls this “a conversion.” It may be religious,
moral, political, artistic, philosophical, scientific, etc., but it
always consists in the substitution of one tendency or group
of tendencies for the contrary, of one belief for its opposite,
of one form of unity for another form, synonymous expressions
which express the different psychological aspects of
transformation. We may note, in passing, that in men who
have passed through two opposite phases, common opinion
is only cognisant of one, usually the final, or else the one
of longest duration and the most conspicuous, the other
being overlooked. We understand by St. Augustine, the
man of the post-conversion, by Diocletian, the man of the
pre-abdication period. This judgment is founded on the
need for simplification and unity of mind as applied to
character.</p>

<p class='c017'>How does this change, dividing life in extreme cases into
two contradictory phases, come about? It is impossible
to reply in general terms; each particular case supposes
special conditions. We may try, however, to determine,
approximately, the causes oftenest in action.</p>

<p class='c017'>First, the physical causes. A serious illness may, by
changing the constitution, transform the character, thus
showing how far it depends on cœnæsthesia. It is immaterial
whether we suppose the ultimate condition to
consist of chemical (or nutritive), or of physical modifications,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>the latter being the view of Henle and Seeland.
There are violent shocks, more especially injuries to the
head, of which we shall take occasion to speak later on.
Azam gives some examples of these metamorphoses.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c010'><sup>[251]</sup></a> A
steady, industrious man sustains a complicated fracture
of the leg and subsequently becomes impulsive and ill-tempered;
the author supposes that there must have been
cerebral ischæmia. Another, under similar circumstances,
exchanges a cheerful disposition for incurable melancholia.
Persistent facial neuralgia has transformed a thoroughly
kind-hearted man into a spiteful and morose being.</p>

<p class='c017'>We now come to the moral causes. They appear to act
like a shock whose effect is either immediate or falls due
some time later; hence the change is either sudden or
consequent on a long incubation. The type of the former
is found in conversions following an unforeseen crisis: St.
Paul and his vision, Pascal and his accident, Raymond
Lulli and the revelation of one of his mistresses; the
Spanish nobleman, Maraña, whose story has so often been
told, who, for half his life, was a Don Juan, and was
suddenly changed by listening to church music. The
“sudden conversions” of theologians involve a psychological
truth. Those of the second type do not take place
all at once, but after a struggle between the old and new
tendencies. St. Augustine, Luther, Loyola, Francisco de
Borgia, who, on seeing the corpse of his empress (Charles V.’s
wife), resolved to renounce the world, but did not do so for
many years after. To these illustrious names each reader
may add for himself less known ones from among his own
acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c017'>We may ask whether even the most sudden changes are,
in truth, as much so as they seem, if they have not their
antecedent conditions in the life of the individual in
question, and are not the accelerated result of a subconscious
process. Whatever we may think, the psychological
mechanism of conversions is very similar to that of
irresistible impulses. In its complete evolution it passes
through three stages: (1) the conception of an opposite
aim or ideal; this may happen to any one without lasting
or leading to action; this state will produce no effect if it
merely passes through the mind. (2) This conception must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>become a <em>fixed</em> idea, with the permanence, the predominance,
the overmastering possession, which are the peculiarities
of such ideas. (3) The action takes place because already
included in the fixed idea, and because the fixed idea is a
belief, and all beliefs presuppose something existing or
about to exist. In short, there is no result till the idea
becomes an impulse. In the cases where the individual is,
so to speak, struck by lightning, the impetuous movement
of the passion springs up suddenly and triumphs immediately.
This is yet another point of resemblance to the
irresistible impulses which pass into action, sometimes after
a period of struggle, sometimes in a sudden ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is, in any case, this difference, that the new
character—<i>i.e.</i>, new ways of feeling, thinking, and acting—is
lasting. This could not be, if in both stages, incubation
and eruption, a profound change had not taken place in
the individual constitution. Conversions do not create a
new tendency, but they show that the greatest antitheses
are latent in us, and that one may replace the other, not
by an act of the will, which is always precarious, but by
a radical transformation of our sensibility.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. This division includes the <em>alternating</em> characters,
whose phases sometimes succeed one another with such
rapidity and frequency as to approximate to the simultaneous
contradictory characters. Instead of two different
characters, one before and one after the crisis, whose
formula for the whole life of the individual would be
A, B, we have the alternation of two forms of character,
with or without intermediary crises, and the formula would
be A, B, A, B, and so on.</p>

<p class='c017'>This alternation is found in the normal or quasi-normal
state, but is too fugitive or too difficult to fix, to be
distinguished from the unstable characters; but the case is
not the same with the morbid types which show it in an
exaggerated form. Such are the phenomena so much
studied in our own day, under the name of alterations,
diseases, disorders of personality. They will be known to
the reader, but they are not altogether germane to our
subject, and I only touch upon them in order to elucidate
a particular point, the variations of character.</p>

<p class='c017'>In cases of alternating personality we may consider either
the physiological changes, which are rather obscure, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>the intellectual changes, which have been referred, on the
whole, to the memory, or the emotional changes, which
have been somewhat neglected and in some observations
omitted altogether. It is these last alone which interest
us, because they may be summed up as alternations of
character.</p>

<p class='c017'>If, in fact, we take complete observations, it will be seen
that the two personalities (there are sometimes more) do
not consist merely in the alternation of two memories, but
also in that of two distinct and usually opposite affective
dispositions. Azam’s celebrated Félida is, in her first
state, gloomy, cold, and reserved; in her second, cheerful,
talkative, lively to the point of coquetry and boisterousness.
In the case of Mary Reynolds, reported by Weir Mitchell,
we have first a melancholy, silent, retiring woman; then, in
her new personality, “her disposition is totally and absolutely
changed,” she is fond of pleasure, noisy, always
seeking company, except when taking long rides and walks
through the woods and over the mountains, delighting in
the spectacle of nature and absolutely unconscious of fear.
These alternations lasted for sixteen years, after which “the
emotional opposition between the two states seems gradually
to have effaced itself,” and resolved itself into a medium
state between the two—"a well-balanced temperament,"
which for a quarter of a century coincided with her now
permanent second state. We may also recall the well-known
case of L. V., who <em>spontaneously</em> showed at the same
time two opposite forms of character: at one time, talkative,
arrogant, violent, brutal, insubordinate, a thief, ready to kill
any one who gave him an order; at another, gentle, polite,
silent, sober, of an almost child-like timidity. I say, spontaneously,
for MM. Bourru and Burot have <em>artificially</em>
produced physical modifications in V. which are accompanied
by some modifications in his character; but I am
only speaking of natural changes. For other instances
I refer the reader to special works on the alteration of
personality.</p>

<p class='c017'>I am inclined to believe that alternations of memory,
though the strongest and most disturbing phenomena, result
from an alternation of the affective dispositions (in other
words, of the character), which themselves result from
physiological changes, so that, in the last resort, we arrive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>at cœnæsthesia as the ultimate cause. When we see, <i>e.g.</i>,
that in L. V. the violent character always accompanies
hemiplegia and anæsthesia on the right side, and the gentle
character, hemiplegia and anæsthesia on the left side, not
to mention the partial modifications accompanying the
paraplegia, total anæsthesia, etc., artificially produced in the
hypnotic state, it is difficult not to admit that changes in
memory, in character, and in physical habit form an almost
indissoluble whole, which is also the conclusion drawn by
Bourru and Burot from their experiments.</p>

<p class='c017'>In default of positive proofs that the change of cœnæsthesia
is primordial in these alternations of character, we
may compare them with a mental disease, where the alternation,
being still simpler, allows us more easily to detect
its physiological conditions. This is that duplex form of
madness, sometimes called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>folie circulaire</i></span>, or “alternating
insanity,” etc. It consists in the regular alternation of two
periods, that of depression and that of exaltation. The
transition from one to the other is instantaneous, or takes
place by imperceptible gradations, but nothing can be
clearer than the contrast between the two periods.</p>

<p class='c017'>During the depression, the affective symptoms are:
melancholy, feeling of fatigue, torpor, indifference, vague
terror, uneasiness with regard to everything. Physically,
the patient is emaciated, aged, broken down, the temperature
is lowered, and there is an enormous decrease in the
pulse, the secretions and excretions, and the weight of the
body, the latter going down as much as ten pounds in one
week.</p>

<p class='c017'>During the period of excitement the reverse takes place,
point for point: a feeling of well-being, joy, pride, exuberant
activity; the patient looks younger, grows stout, and his
organic functions go on extensively and regularly. “This
contrast,” says an alienist, “is one of the most curious and
interesting peculiarities of mental medicine.”<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c010'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>Here the connection between the affective disposition
and the somatic state is quite clear, and seems to be
referable to a tropho-neurosis of the brain (Schüle, Krafft-Ebing).
It must be recognised that this disease, which is
the extreme form, and the alternations of personality, which
are modified forms, supply us with none but pathological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>examples; but the germs of morbid manifestations are
present in normal life. Unfortunately, these alternations
are only perceptible where strongly marked, and therefore
none but exaggerated cases can be quoted. Compared to
the successive characters, where the second has destroyed
the first, the alternating characters mark a new stage on the
road to dissolution, and form a transition to our second
group—the <em>coexistent</em> contradictory characters.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>They consist in the coexistence of two opposite tendencies
of equal force and mutually incompatible; there
are two characters, two contradictory springs of action,
and, tested by our practical criterion, there are, in any given
circumstances, two possible and equally probable courses
to be foreseen. They differ, both from the successive
characters, in which the second man has eliminated the
first, and from the alternating characters, which occupy the
stage, in turn, <em>exclusively</em>, and for some time. They present
themselves under two principal forms.</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The first form is not a pure or complete type. It is
the result of a contradiction between thought and feeling,
between theory and practice, between principle and tendency.
Nothing is less rare, and I need scarcely adduce examples:
the contrast between a man’s private and public life,
between his aspect as a scientific man and his aspect
as a believer. One who, in a question of scientific proof,
is quite intractable, will show, in religion or in love, an
unparalleled simplicity and ingenuousness. As for those
who loudly profess any given doctrine, and contradict it by
their actions, there is no lack of them. Schopenhauer, in
theory a pessimist and misogynist, penetrated with compassion
for all living beings, a professed ascetic, was nothing
of the sort in practice. He is an instance of unreconciled
contradiction, to which we may oppose the perfect unity of
a Spinoza.</p>

<p class='c017'>A man who was, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ex hypothesi</i></span>, entirely intellectual, and
yet (if that were possible) capable of acting, would, by
his constitution, escape this contradictory duality. The
magistrate, observed by Esquirol, who, though perfectly lucid
in mind, had lost all sensibility, and was “as indifferent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>his family and everything else as to a theorem of Euclid,”
approximates to it. We find modified forms of the same
in the apathetic-intellectual division.</p>

<p class='c017'>But this contradictory duality is so common that we
should not venture to insist on it were it not that it completely
exposes the inanity of the widespread prejudice
that it is sufficient to inculcate principles, rules, and ideas, in
order to make them result in action. No doubt, authority,
education, law, have no other means of influencing men;
but these means, by themselves, are not efficacious; they
may succeed, or they may fail. The question which the
experiment is intended to solve amounts to this: Do the
intellectual character (if there are, as some writers admit,
such things as intellectual characters, properly speaking)
and the emotional keep an even rate of progress?</p>

<p class='c017'>2. The second form is pure and complete; it involves a
deeper contradiction because subsisting between two ways
of feeling, two tendencies, two modes of action, one of
which is the negative of the other. These characters bring
us to our last group, the unstable; there are incoherent
beings who will not or cannot resolve the contradiction
in them. One of the commonest instances is that of
those men who carry to an extreme degree both religious
sincerity and licentiousness of conduct. Popular opinion
judges them severely and considers them hypocrites, thus
confounding two very distinct cases, that of voluntary
dissimulation and that of incurable contradiction. The
religious and the sexual sentiment, both deeply rooted in
their natures, act on them, each in its turn; and they make
no attempt to reconcile the two. We may also mention those
men who are divided between the craving for activity and
that for repose, passing incessantly from the one to the other;
the lover who feels for his mistress at the same time an
ardent love and a violent contempt. In towns and
countries where the monarchical sentiment is still deeply
rooted we find an analogous state of mind in some subjects,
who feel an unutterable loyalty to the throne and a profound
contempt for the person of the king. In studying the
“composite characters,” Paulhan reminds us that Rubens,
calm, tranquil, and of decent behaviour in practical life,
became a prey to a tragic fermentation as soon as he seized
his brush. It has been said of a celebrated contemporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>(Wagner) that he had in him “the instincts of an ascetic
and of a satyr, cravings for love and hatred, an appetite for
enjoyment and a thirst for the ideal, a haughty dignity and
a cringing courtiership, a mixture of devotion and base
treachery.” This portrait might suit many others. It
denotes something more than a contradictory duality, for
it cannot be reduced to two essential points; but it is not
yet the genuine type of the unstable.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we might trust certain authors, the cause of simultaneous
contradictory characters would be very simple, being
due merely to the dual form of the brain. It is known
that the two cerebral hemispheres, even when normal, are
asymmetrical, differing in weight, in the distribution of the
arteries, and in functional importance, the left having the
preponderance; that hallucinations may be unilateral or
bilateral, vary in character, etc. In short, cerebral dualism
is undeniable; but that it should suffice to explain the
duality of character is a hypothesis of such exceeding
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>naïveté</i></span> that I am unwilling to waste any time in discussing
it.</p>

<p class='c017'>An explanation drawn from psychology is less simple,
but also less easily overthrown. To understand how
characters are constituted, the following process seems to
me the best. Let us take as our starting-point the well-balanced,
“completely unified” characters, which present
a graduated co-ordination of the various tendencies. The
first step towards a break is marked by the predominance
of a single tendency: the character is active, contemplative,
sensitive, etc. It is still a unity; but, instead of a convergent
unity which may be compared to a federation, we have
a unity of preponderance reminding us of an absolute
monarchy. A second decisive step is marked by the
appearance of two dominant tendencies, but, to fulfil the
conditions, they must be contradictory. Thus, Miguel
Cervantes, who, after a life of chivalrous adventure, became
the great novelist, gives us an instance of a complex and
composite but by no means contradictory nature. The
contradiction is found in cases analogous to that of the
devout libertine, because, while asserting in words the rule
of morals prescribed by his religion, he denies it by his acts.
Hence two un-coordinated tendencies. Yet this is only
the exaggeration of a perfectly normal occurrence. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>man of grave demeanour may have sudden fits of mad
spirits; another may be seized upon by a passion at variance
with all his habits. If this transitory, episodic state becomes
stable and permanent, the contradictory character
is established. This transformation may be assigned to
circumstances. I believe that it is still more dependent
on innate tendencies inherent in the individual constitution,
which are only developed by opportunity.</p>

<p class='c017'>Speaking decisively, we may maintain, without paradox,
that these characters are or are not contradictory, according
to the point of view adopted. They are so for the logic of
the intellect, but not for the logic of the feelings.</p>

<p class='c017'>When we judge a contradictory character, whether our
own or another person’s, we are apt to proceed <em>objectively</em>;
we ascertain in the individual the simultaneous existence of
two governing ideas, one of which negatives the other; we
rationally declare this to be illogical, because the principle
of contradiction is the pith of all our affirmations, and the
logic of the intellect rests on it.</p>

<p class='c017'>The logic of the feelings is <em>subjective</em>; it is ruled by the
principle of finality or adaptation. The individual, as a
purely emotional being, aims at one end only, the satisfaction
of his desires; and in him every special tendency
makes for its own special end, its own special good. If,
therefore, the scholar, moved by the love of truth, strives
after strict truth, and moved by a strong religious sentiment,
satisfies himself with childish beliefs, there is not and cannot
be any contradiction between these two desires; the discrepancy
exists only objectively, in the region of ideas.</p>

<p class='c017'>The logic of the feelings also has its illogicalities, but of
another sort, and I can only find two: (1) when an isolated
tendency, in attaining its end, is the cause of injury or ruin
to the whole individual; and (2) when the individual is
quite content with his own destruction, as in the case of
the “luxury of grief,” which we have studied elsewhere, and
whose highest term is the fascination of suicide.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III.</h4>
<p class='c019'>Unstable or polymorphic characters cannot be called
“characters” except by an abuse of that word, for there is
neither unity, stability, nor possibility of prevision. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>will they act? Every fresh moment brings us face to face
with another enigma. In fact, we have here to do with
the decay of character, and all the specimens given in this
group are pathological.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is needless to describe them, for they are self-evident.
Their principal types are to be met with in the hysterical,
whose Protean psychology has so often and so thoroughly
been studied that we need not dwell on it; in the adventurer,
whose history, with its numberless variations, is, in
the main, always the same, and may be summarised thus:
precocity, insubordination at home or at school, frequent
flights, inaptitude for all sustained work; he passes suddenly
from enthusiasm to disgust, tries everything in turn and
drops it, drifting at the caprice of impulse or circumstance,
till some final catastrophe lands him in the prisoner’s dock
or the lunatic asylum.</p>

<p class='c017'>The causes of this instability are either congenital or
acquired.</p>

<p class='c017'>The spasmodic diathesis, as Maudsley calls it, is most
usually innate. It is characterised by the various symptoms
comprised under the name of degeneration, grouped as
physical and psychical stigmata; they are too well known
to need enumeration.</p>

<p class='c017'>The instability acquired in the course of life is left
behind by certain maladies, especially injuries or shocks to
the brain, and above all, lesions of the frontal lobe. Such
is the conclusion resulting from the observations of David
Ferrier, Boyer, Lépine, and others. More recently, Allen
Starr,<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c010'><sup>[253]</sup></a> out of forty-six cases, has ascertained that, in twenty-three,
the only symptoms were mental obtuseness, impossibility
of attention, irritability, un-coordinated and impulsive
acts, absence of voluntary control and the loss of inhibitory
power, phenomena specially coinciding with lesions on the
left side of the frontal region.</p>

<p class='c017'>M. Paulhan, in his book on Characters, when studying
those whom he calls the unquiet, the nervous, and the
contradictory (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>contrariants</i></span>), gives several instances; among
others, Alfred de Musset, from his own portrait, confirmed
by that given by G. Sand. Let us listen to each of them in
turn.</p>

<p class='c017'>“When these frightful scenes were over, a strange love,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>an exaltation carried to excess, made me treat my mistress
as a divinity. A quarter of an hour after I had insulted
her I was at her knees; as soon as I ceased to accuse her
I asked her pardon; the moment I was no longer uttering
bitter words I burst into tears” (Musset). “His reactions
were sudden and violent in proportion to the
acuteness of his joys.... One might have thought that
two souls were engaged in a desperate contest as to which
should animate his body.... It was an invariable rule,
unheard of, but absolute in this strange organisation, that,
sleep changing all his resolutions, he would go to rest
with his heart full of tenderness, and awaken in the morning
eager for battle and murder; but if he had left in the
evening cursing, he returned next morning to bless”
(G. Sand). Hence, and from analogous cases, Paulhan
concludes that “these types result from the predominance
of association by contrast.” It seems to me impossible to
refer the psychology of the unstable, and of the contradictory
characters which come nearest to them, to this single
fact. In the first place, association by contrast is not a
primary fact. Psychologists are right in connecting it indirectly
with association by resemblance, sometimes mixed
with elements of contiguity. Furthermore, contrasts only
exist in couples, and in the “nervous, unquiet, and contradictory”
there is not merely a transition from contrast to
contrast, but from difference to difference—they traverse the
whole scale. Lastly, association by contrast only has a
precise form as an <em>intellectual</em> phenomenon, and it could not
be maintained that love, as a representation, would suggest
the <em>representation</em> of violence, or the <i>i.e.</i> of jealousy that
of indifference. Here the association of ideas is only an
effect, a result, a rendering to the consciousness of deeper
occurrences belonging to the emotional or even the organic
part of us. If Musset, having represented George Sand to
himself as a divinity, rages at her immediately afterwards,
as a brutal planter might at a slave, his change of attitude is
in his feelings, not in his thoughts. I see rather the effect
of a rapid but partial exhaustion,—a frequent occurrence in
unbalanced natures. If we insist on retaining the word
contrast, it will have to be taken, not in its psychological
sense, but in that given to it by physiologists when they
speak of “successive contrast,” and attribute it, rightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>or wrongly, to the fatigue of certain portions of the
retina.</p>

<p class='c017'>The formula which, in my opinion, sums up and explains
the unstable is this: <em>psychological infantilism</em>. We might
also call it arrest of development, but this latter expression
would not be applicable to all cases.</p>

<p class='c017'>If, in fact, we consider the distinctive marks of the
character of children, apart from exceptions, we find, first,
mobility. They wish for one thing, and then another and
another; they pass rapidly from one extreme to the opposite,
from eagerness to disgust, from laughter to tears; the
character is an un-coordinated bundle of appetites and
wishes, each of which, in turn, drives out the rest. Then
there is weakness or total absence of will under its higher
inhibitory form, which rules and co-ordinates. Are they
impulsive for want of inhibition, or incapable of controlling
themselves through the excess of their impulses? Both
these cases are met with, and the result is the same. The
formula of their character, which we need not enumerate in
detail, is the same as that of the unstable—<i>i.e.</i>, there is no
constituted character.</p>

<p class='c017'>The term <em>infantilism</em> is equally applicable to the congenital
and the acquired forms. The former have never
left their childhood behind, the latter return to it; they are
on the same level, the first through not having climbed high
enough, the second through having descended too far. In
the one case we have arrested development, in the other
retrogression. It is no objection to say that this instability
has often been met with in minds of a superior calibre;
genius is one thing, character another, and we are here
dealing with character only. The populace, who, struck by
the incoherence of their conduct, call these people “grown-up
children,” have hit on the right expression, without any
subtleties of analysis.</p>

<p class='c017'>In short, beginning with the <em>true</em> character (<i>i.e.</i>, the
affirmation of a personality under a stable form consistent
with itself), which is never completely realised, or free from
transient eclipses, there are all possible shades of deviation
from unity and stability, till we reach that stage of uncoordinated
multiplicity at which character has either not
come into being or has ceased to exist.</p>

  <h3 id='ch2.14' class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br /> THE DECAY OF THE AFFECTIVE LIFE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Law of Decay: its formula, and its general application in
psychology—Difficulties where the affective life is concerned—Successive
disappearance of the disinterested
emotions (the æsthetic and intellectual), of the altruistic
(moral and social), the ego-altruistic (religious feeling,
ambition, etc.), and lastly, the egoistic—Converse proof:
cases of arrested development—Theory of degeneration—Its
relation to decay.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>At the opening of this work I gave a general survey of the
evolution of the affective life; at its close we have to undertake
a task of an opposite nature: the survey of its decay.
Does this take place at haphazard, varying from one man to
another? or does it follow a regular and ascertainable
course? Is it reducible to any formula which can be
referred to a law?</p>

<p class='c017'>The law of decay, in psychology, consists in a continuous
retrogression, descending from the higher to the lower, from
the complex to the simple, from the unstable to the stable,
from the most to the least organised; in other words, those
manifestations which are the latest in date of evolution are
the first to disappear; while those which were the first to
appear are the last to vanish. Evolution and decay follow
opposite courses.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have already shown that the slow and continuous
disappearance of memory verifies this formula, and, as
a converse proof, that, in the rare cases where this
faculty is recovered, the restoration proceeds, step by
step, in the opposite direction, up the path previously
descended. The methodical process of decay is still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>better seen in motor psychology. I may perhaps be
permitted, by way of elucidation and preparation, to
recapitulate briefly what I have detailed at greater length
elsewhere: motor retrogression in the well-known case of
drunkenness. There is, first, a period of excitement, even
of exuberant spirits, which is the very antithesis of reflection;
that is to say that attention under its highest form, as the
result of a motor convergence, can no longer exist. Next, a
man can no longer control his tongue, he tells all his secrets;
the will, under its higher, inhibitory form, has disappeared.
After this, he becomes incapable of any continuous plan or
action: the will, even under its lower or impulsive form,
remains powerless. Then the most delicate voluntary
movements, those of speech and of the hands, cease to be coordinated.
One degree lower, he loses the semi-automatic
movements, those of walking: he staggers and loses his
balance. Still lower, the muscular tonicity is weakened,
he falls from his seat under the table; then the reflex
movements are abolished; and finally, if the condition is
continued long enough, there is cessation of the automatic
movements—those of respiration and of the heart. Here
is a well-marked, easily determinable retrograde process,
the psychological function of the movements being comparatively
simple.</p>

<p class='c017'>The object of this chapter is to prove that the disappearance
of feelings, when it takes place gradually and continuously,
in consequence of age or of some slowly evolved
malady (general paralysis, senile dementia, etc.), conforms
to the same law. But, by reason of the complexity of the
affective life, the question presents some difficulties which
we must first of all point out.</p>

<p class='c017'>The first is this: May not affective retrogression be
simply the consequence of an intellectual retrogression?
or must we take it as primary, independent, and self-determined,
not secondary and consequent upon the decay
of intellect? Or else—and this view appears to me the
most probable—do both cases occur? It is impossible to
give a categorical answer; the two elements, the intellectual
and the affective, being closely associated. Yet, as retrogression
is irremediable and results from organic decay or
waste, the presumption is rather in favour of a gradual
extinction of the tendencies.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>The second difficulty is at least equally important.
We have admitted that in every normal person all the
primary tendencies exist; but their coexistence does not
imply their equality. Experience proves this. The individual
character results from the preponderance of one
or more tendencies: the æsthetic or the sexual, the moral
or the religious; one man is constitutionally timid, and
another choleric. It follows from this that all cases of
retrogression are not strictly comparable with one another;
for it is evident that the dominant tendency is better able
than the rest to withstand shocks and assaults, and to resist
destructive action. This, in my opinion, explains how it is
that—as in a case mentioned below—the æsthetic sentiment,
one of the most delicate and latest in formation, is of very
late extinction in an artist. This apparent exception is, in
fact, a confirmation of the law.</p>

<p class='c017'>The ideal case for illustrating our subject would be this:
An average man, all of whose tendencies are nearly equipollent,
is struck down by a disease involving slow retrogression,
so that the order in which the feelings are weakened and
extinguished can be noted; then the decadence stops
short, and is followed by a restoration of the affective life,
which can be followed, step by step, in its gradual ascent,
so as to ascertain whether it is or is not the repetition, in
reversed order, of the period of dissolution. The search for
such a case, however, would be no less than the pursuit of a
chimera. The only practical method would be to collect
a great number of observations on different patients, and
thus draw up a schematic table of decay, analogous to
Galton’s composite photographs—formed by the accumulation
of resemblances and the elimination of individual
differences. This is what I shall try to do, as far as
the extreme scarcity of material and the difficulties of an
unexplored subject will permit. I shall first examine dissolution
properly so called; then, by way of converse proof,
the arrest of development.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I.</h4>
<p class='c019'>As the decay of the feelings progresses from the higher
to the lower, from complex adaptation to simple adaptation,
gradually narrowing the area of the affective life, we may, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>this decadence, distinguish four phases, marked by the
successive disappearance of (1) the disinterested emotions,
(2) the altruistic emotions, (3) the ego-altruistic emotions,
and (4) the purely egoistic emotions.</p>

<p class='c017'>(1.) I class under the first head the æsthetic emotions
and the higher forms of intellectual emotions, which aim at
no practical or utilitarian end, but are luxuries, not necessaries
of life. Æsthetic and scientific cravings are so
slightly marked, and so far from imperative in the majority
of men, that it is impossible to demonstrate with certainty
that they are the first to disappear; but it may be indirectly
inferred.</p>

<p class='c017'>It cannot be denied that those who have a passion for
art or science, and for whom these are necessary conditions
of life, are extremely rare compared with those who are
moved or possessed by love, the desire for riches, or
ambition. In the mass of men the æsthetic and intellectual
feelings remain in a rudimentary condition, or attain
only a slight, at most a medium development, and it
cannot be said with certainty when they become extinct,
seeing they have never really existed. Compared with
the higher forms, they resemble a case of arrested development,
<i>i.e.</i>, of retrogression; and this arrest of development
is the rule, as it must be for all tendencies beyond
the bounds of the mere necessities of life.</p>

<p class='c017'>To this negative proof I may add other positive proofs.</p>

<p class='c017'>Age and diseases whose effect is retrogressive diminish,
if they do not annihilate, zeal, enthusiasm, the impulse
towards creation, discovery, or the simple enjoyment of
art, and the curiosity which is always on the alert. I
omit some very rare exceptions, each of which would
require individual examination. In the majority of men
weakened vitality at once destroys all taste for the
superfluous.</p>

<p class='c017'>We must also note the decided hostility to all innovations—new
forms of art, new discoveries, new ways of
stating or treating scientific questions—which comes on
with old age. The fact is so well known as to make proof
unnecessary. As a general thing, in art especially, every
generation rejects that which follows it. The usual explanation
of this “misoneism” is that there is a fixed cerebral
constitution, organised intellectual habits. Yes—but if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>proposed new scientific or artistic ideal caused a true,
deep, intense emotion, it would break down and sweep
away the barriers of habit. There would be a shock, a
turning upside down, a conversion. Cases of a rupture
with the artistic or scientific past sometimes occur, but
rarely, as they presuppose the possibility of a violent
shock and the revival of an imperious passion, but turned
in another direction. This repulsion for novelty is rather
of emotional than of intellectual origin; it is a sign of the
weakening of the affective life, and of a tendency towards
diminished effort, repose, inertia.</p>

<p class='c017'>(2.) The altruistic feelings (social and moral emotions)
having a practical value, and being reckoned among the
conditions of human existence, it is much easier to fix the
moment of their partial or total decay. Now, the preceding
groups apart, they are the first to disappear. They
may have been altered or extinct for a long period, while the
ego-altruistic, and still more the egoistic tendencies, are
still intact. We have seen, again and again, how quickly
persons become unsociable and ungovernable through
dementia, general paralysis, melancholia, epilepsy, hysteria,
shock, and injuries to the head.</p>

<p class='c017'>But their retrogression takes place by gradations to be
determined by observation alone.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c010'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c017'>Case 1. "F—— entered the asylum December 20, 1889,
suffering from general paralysis, which took the form of
dementia. He was an intelligent, well-educated man, capable
of filling a brilliant position in society. Being a gifted
musician, he became well known as a violoncellist and his
playing was long an attraction at the most frequented concerts.
What especially struck one in this patient on his admission
was his utter indifference to all about him—doctors, nurses,
and patients alike. When shown an aged dementia patient
who was dying he was neither touched nor disturbed, but
simply remarked, ‘There’s one of ’em going to croak’ (‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>En
voilà un qui va claquer</i></span>’). To suggestions that he should leave
the asylum and mingle again in society, he never returned any
other answer than ‘I like my own comfort too well—I wish
people would leave me in peace.’ The more general altruistic
feelings, therefore, would seem at this date to have vanished;
but family affection, especially filial love, is still intact. F——
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>incessantly speaks of his father, wants to write to him, to see
him. On being shown his picture he burst into tears. The
personal feelings are still intact, the love of liberty, and the
instinct of self-preservation in all its forms.</p>

<p class='c017'>"Jan. 15, 1891 (a year and a half later). F—— is now in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>gâteux</i></span> ward. The feelings already ruined or destroyed have
not reappeared. Retrogression has gone on almost uninterruptedly.
F—— no longer speaks of his father, and if spoken
to about him he replies with indifference. One day, all his
family being assembled at the foot of his bed, he recognised
each of his relations and spoke to them by name, but showed
no emotion whatever; the moment of separation left him as
indifferent as their arrival had found him.</p>

<p class='c017'>"Even the egoistic feelings are now impaired; he no longer
demands freedom of movement. Eating is the only thing that
interests him; he devours ravenously, and, after his meals,
picks up the crumbs which have fallen on the bed-clothes.
The nutritive instinct is the last surviving.</p>

<p class='c017'>"Yet, in this patient, the artistic feeling long remains unimpaired,
for the reason indicated above, viz., that it is the
direct expression of his temperament, and an essential part of
his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ego</i></span>: because he is an artist.</p>

<p class='c017'>"Two months after his admission into the asylum, though
devoid of social tendencies and generous feeling, he was still
able to co-ordinate his movements and play his old tunes on
the violoncello. One day, in the garden, he was found gazing
ecstatically at the blue sky, flecked with small white clouds; he
was saying, ‘How beautiful it is! how beautiful it is!’ Nothing
else, by-the-bye, could be got from him that day. Chance
having brought the famous violinist X—— as a visitor to the
asylum about a month before F.’s death, he was asked to play
to the latter. The patient had been, for some time, in the
last stage of insanity and was past understanding anything,
yet he understood this, and when he heard the familiar airs of
old times played on the violin his eye became clear, and for a
minute the mind seemed to have found itself again under the
influence of art."</p>

<p class='c017'>Case 2. “Ph. R——, aged 70, suffering from senile dementia,
was up to this age an intelligent, peaceable, respectable citizen.
At the last elections he presented himself as a candidate for the
Chamber, and, in spite of the protests of his family, placed
himself at the head of an Anarchist group, and drew up a
programme which we will not inflict on the reader. He claimed
to have received 700 votes. However that may be, it became
necessary to place him in seclusion. His political and social
tendencies perished in the first catastrophe, but his domestic
feelings still remained intact. He spoke of his family with a
touching simplicity. A letter written to his brother-in-law (too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>long for reproduction here, but very sensible) furnishes throughout
irrefragable proofs of this. Gradually these feelings became
weaker, the disease progressed rapidly, he became dirty in
his habits, and the only function now remaining is the generative
instinct in its simplest form, as masturbation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>In the following cases intellectual retrogression seems to
precede and determine the affective evolution:—</p>

<p class='c023'>Case 3. "D——, a general paralytic, on his admission into
the asylum, is fond of talking of the 3000 francs he has invested;
he is much occupied with the dividends and coupons now due
which he ought to have received. On inquiries being made
all this was found to be accurate. He had, therefore, a tolerably
clear idea of property, since this idea was suggested by the
image of certain papers representing the values involved. At
a later period, when spoken to about his 3000 francs, he had
forgotten everything and did not understand. When reminded
of what he had himself said, and that he possessed the values
guaranteed by the receipts, he understood no more than before.
But D—— carries money about with him, and knows very well
how much he has at the time. ‘For ten centimes,’ he says, ‘I
can have a cup of coffee every day, and I have three francs.’
The sight of a white, shining metal is sufficient to awaken in
him the idea of possession represented by the pleasure to be
bought with it." Three months later he no longer understands
even this third degree of possession: possession with him
means having something to eat; the piece of bread which
he is holding in his hand and greedily devouring is the only
thing he cannot be induced to give up.</p>

<p class='c024'>Case 4. "M——, formerly employed in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>octroi</i></span>; paralytic
dementia. During the first few days after his admission he
gave himself up to political divagations, spoke much of universal
suffrage, and especially of liberty. When asked for a definition
of this word he gave the following explanation: ‘Liberty
is the right to do what one wishes.’ A short time after this he
ceased to make speeches and seemed to collapse. He was no
longer capable of giving his definition, or of understanding it;
when pressed with questions he said at last, ‘Liberty is being
able to walk about in the yard.’ The abstract idea is replaced
by a concrete idea indicating an assemblage of movements.
Later still, a few days before his death, he answered the same
question with, ‘Being free is when any one is in bed; I shall
be free when I am in bed.’ The idea of liberty, therefore,
was at last confused in his mind with that of a vague state of
comfort."</p>

<p class='c017'>These observations show how the group of altruistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>sentiments dissolves piecemeal, and the affective sphere
narrows itself more and more. The first to disappear are
the vaguest and weakest of all the forms of benevolence—those
embracing the whole human race; then the family
emotions, which are more stable, more restricted, more
frequently repeated; finally, there is absolute indifference
to every one.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c010'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'>(3.) The ego-altruistic emotions (to employ H. Spencer’s
terminology) form a group whose limits are vague, floating,
and indecisive. It is even uncertain whether it exists as
a distinct group or simply corresponds to a particular
“moment” in the evolution of complex emotions. Without
arguing this point, or attaching any importance to it,
I employ this formula, because it is a convenient one in
following step by step the retrogression from pure altruism
to pure egoism.</p>

<p class='c017'>Sexual love is a fairly good representative of the group.
Need we say that, appearing later than the other instincts,
it disappears before them, thus being in strict conformity
with the law of retrogression. It does not belong to childhood,
but neither does it to old age. We must eliminate
the survivals and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>simulacra</i></span>, which are only a factitious
product of imagination; we are dealing with the tendency
under its normal and complete form, with <em>all</em> its physiological
and psychological conditions.</p>

<p class='c017'>The religious sentiment in its medium forms, neither too
coarse nor too subtle, belongs also to this category, plunging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>its roots deeply into the individual, but in order to rise
beyond him. Of its two constituent elements, love tends
towards the dispossession of the individual; the other,
fear, towards strict egoism; with retrogression, the
latter becomes exclusive. The believer, especially in the
melancholic state, at first complains of being wanting in
pity, fervour, love of God; he no longer finds consolation
in prayer. Thus, as decadence increases, or simply in consequence
of age and the approach of death, the egoistic
anxiety about personal salvation becomes imperious. This
was the time of life when the kings, princes, and lords of
the Middle Ages multiplied pious foundations—monasteries,
churches, and hospitals; and the same thing still takes
place, in our own day, in religions which admit of the
efficacy of works in purchasing salvation, and of prayers for
the dead. The religious feeling thus comes back to fear,
its primary form in evolution. We might also note the
frequent survival of observances and rites when the <em>true</em>
feeling has disappeared, <i>i.e.</i>, the solidity of the organic and
automatic element. In a retrograding religion, dogma dissolves
before outward acts of worship, which, as we have
seen, is the inversion of the evolutionary process.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ambition is the type of the higher form of egoism; but
as it must take into account the nature of other men and
employ them in carrying out its designs, it is a modified
form of egoism. We know how tenacious and durable is
this passion in its numerous forms—the pursuit of power,
honour, renown, riches; in it we have a foretaste of the
stability of egoism after the ruin of all other tendencies.
It disappears when the stage is reached when man sincerely
declares himself disgusted with everything, and speaks like
the author of Ecclesiastes. The greatest of the Cordovan
Caliphs, Abderrhaman III., who noted down the principal
events of this life, wrote: “I have reigned fifty years in
peace and in war, loved by my people, feared by my
enemies, respected by my allies, seeing my friendship
sought for by the greatest kings on earth. Nothing have
I lacked that the heart of man could desire—neither glory,
nor power, nor pleasures. Yet, having counted the days in
this long life in which I enjoyed unalloyed happiness, I
found that there were fourteen.” But this contempt for
human interests comes late, and springs rather from weakness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>than from wisdom. Men renounce the world, not so
much because they have weighed it and estimated it at its
true value, as because they no longer have the courage to
conquer or keep it. Except in the case of philosophers,
the disappearance of all ambition is the first symptom of
the decadence of the egoistic tendencies: it indicates weariness,
exhaustion, and a want of faith in one’s self.</p>

<p class='c017'>(4.) The last group, that of the strictly egoistic feelings,
the most general and most firmly organised of all, is the last
to disappear. The threefold group formed by the offensive
instinct (anger), the defensive instincts (fear), and the nutritive
cravings, persists in men and animals up to the farthest
limit of consciousness. We know that anger makes its
appearance later than fear; does it vanish earlier? I have
no data to enable me to reply to this question. What is
certain is that the affective states associated with nutrition
last to the end, and that all remaining activity is concentrated
in them, as shown by the cases above quoted. The
fact, moreover, is so well known that there is no need to
dwell on it.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II.</h4>
<p class='c019'>We have just seen how the process of decay, beginning
at the top of the building, gradually destroys all its storeys,
one after another, as it descends to the foundations. It
would be interesting to ascertain whether the work of
restoration would follow, as it ought, the inverse order;
but, when decay has fully accomplished its task, all is over,
without hope of recovery. We only meet with partial and
fragmentary cases of restoration. In the absence of this
converse proof we may proceed from below upwards, not
to retrace the normal evolution of the affective life, which
has already been done, but to consider the cases in which
this evolution remains in a rudimentary state, or becomes
abortive at various stages of its ascending progress, <i>i.e.</i>, in
idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, human beings of
incomplete development.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the lowest stage, that of the complete idiot, all
instincts are wanting, even that of nutrition. In infancy
idiots only learn to take the breast with difficulty. At a
more advanced age, there are some who feel neither hunger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>nor thirst; the sight of food fails to awaken them from their
torpor, and without the help of others they would perish of
inanition. Ordinary cases, on a higher level than this,
show unbounded voracity. Idiots may be capable of
feeling nothing but the nutritive cravings, and giving no
signs of pleasure or pain except inarticulate growls, shrill
cries, or strident laughter.</p>

<p class='c017'>The complete idiot shows no sign of fear; he cannot
fear, because he feels and comprehends nothing. Those
less devoid of sensibility dread punishment, especially
blows.</p>

<p class='c017'>With regard to anger, there are the apathetic and insensible,
and, above them, in imbeciles, fits of bestial
rage, with convulsions, suffocations, violent impulses, and
destructive cravings.</p>

<p class='c017'>Those who pass the purely egoistic stage and do not
remain totally indifferent to those about them, show a
vague and transient affection for the person who takes care
of them. Others, less destitute, “seem amiable and
affectionate, and we may compare these patients to the
dog who fawns on those who caress him” (Schüle). The
highest step attained by them, and that rarely, is a certain
sense of injustice. Itard observed this in his famous
“savage of the Aveyron,” whom he had purposely punished
without cause.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c010'><sup>[256]</sup></a> In short, the social and moral tendencies
are rudimentary or non-existent.</p>

<p class='c017'>With regard to the sex-instinct, it is either entirely absent
or there are various perversions and unrestrained erethism.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lastly, there are some who can rise to a rudimentary
manifestation of the superfluous or disinterested feelings.
The idiot, as a rule, does not play; he is self-centred,
isolated, and has no surplus vitality to expend. That
activity which seems to live on itself and costs no effort,
but is a source of pleasure without fatigue, is almost, if not
quite, unknown to him. Even when invited and induced
to play, he does so with little enthusiasm. We find, however,
a rudiment of artistic tendency in those who have
some taste for drawing or music. We may note, in passing,
that the musical faculty being, as we know, one of the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>to appear, ought also to be one of the last to disappear.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c010'><sup>[257]</sup></a>
But all this is very poor and reduces itself to mere imitation,
and even this natural and simple tendency is wanting
among the lower grades of the feeble-minded.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such, briefly, is the balance-sheet of the affective life in
these disinherited ones. It is generally admitted that, in
this abortive development, there are two main periods: the
first lasting from birth till about the third or fourth
year, when, if arrest of development takes place, the
psychic state remains almost <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span>; the second, from the
fourth year onwards, allows of a less scanty, but a discordant
and perverted psychology. In both cases, the evolution,
however incomplete, reproduces in all its stages the contrary
order to that of decay.</p>

<p class='c017'>It will be necessary, in concluding this study of decay, to
say a few words about a doctrine, much used and abused in
these days, and often alluded to in the course of this work,
which stands in direct relation to the pathology of the
feelings, and, in short, permits us to return some sort of
answer to the question put at the beginning of this
chapter: the Theory of Degeneration.</p>

<p class='c017'>When we review the abnormal or morbid forms of the
affective life: destructive impulses, phobias, incurable
melancholy, sexual perversions, failure of the moral sense,
insanity of doubt, etc., and seek their causes, we at once
find some which are proximate or immediate. Among the
most frequent are physical maladies, injuries to the head,
sudden shocks, as in railway accidents; sorrow, whatever its
origin, whether love, ambition, ruin, separation; intellectual
overwork, and excesses of all sorts. A little reflection,
however, shows us that the alleged causes are not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span><em>whole</em> cause—that, in fact, they are often, rather, accidental
and occasional. One man bears courageously or even cheerfully
a loss under which his neighbour succumbs. Many
are able to give themselves up with impunity to excesses of
pleasure or work, physical or mental. Of the passengers in
the same train, at the time of an accident, the greater
number will suffer nothing worse than fright, while one
perhaps may on this account become insane, or permanently
subject to phobias. To explain this difference of results
under identical conditions, we must seek a supplementary
cause in the constitution of the individual himself. When
he offers only a slight resistance, and succumbs to the
least shock, we say that he is a degenerate.</p>

<p class='c017'>The conception of degenerescence as a fundamental
cause is due, as every one knows, to Morel, and has
flourished famously since his day. Unfortunately, it has
been called in to account for occurrences so numerous and
so dissimilar that, in the end, it has brought down on itself
the suspicions of some writers, who have recently stigmatised
it as a “metaphysical,” <i>i.e.</i>, vague and transcendental
explanation. In fact, different writers seem to understand
by this word totally different things. The original propounder
of the doctrine had a clear if not a correct
notion of degenerescence. “The clearest idea,” says Morel,
“which we can form of human degenerescence is by
representing it to ourselves as a morbid deviation from a
primitive type. This deviation, however simple we may
suppose it at its origin, nevertheless contains such elements
of transmissibility that he who carries its germ in himself
becomes more and more incapable of performing his
functions as a member of the human race, and progress,
already impaired in his person, is threatened in those
of his descendants.... Degenerescence and morbid
deviation from the normal type of humanity are therefore,
in my idea, one and the same thing.” This is quite clear.
Morel, as a Christian, believed in a typical man, perfect as
he came from the hands of the Creator: such a belief
simplifies many things. This position has been given up.
At present, we understand by degenerescence, a morbid
predisposition, having its peculiar signs, its physical and
psychical “stigmata.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The physical stigmata, which have been enumerated at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>great length by specialist writers, consist in anomalies of the
skeleton, the muscular and the digestive system, of the
respiratory, circulatory, and genito-urinary apparatus, of
the skin, the special sense-organs, of speech, and especially
of the central and peripheral nervous system. The detailed
lists contain about sixty items.</p>

<p class='c017'>The psychic stigmata are more vaguely defined. The
principal are: irritability, showing itself in a marked disproportion
between action and reaction; instability of
character, absence of unity, of consent, incessant changes,
eccentric conduct, painful haunting by fixed ideas, irresistible
impulses, or extraordinary apathy.</p>

<p class='c017'>It has been objected to this doctrine that, of a thousand
individuals taken at random, there is perhaps not a single
one who does not show one or more of the stigmata, so
that the whole human race would be included in the alleged
class of degenerates. No stigma, it has been said, is specific
by itself; neither is any group of symptoms, at least in a
clear and indisputable form; so that one can come to no
conclusion from them.</p>

<p class='c017'>This and other difficulties have supplied matter for many
discussions, into which this is not the place to enter.
Degenerescence, whatever its value as an explanation,
and the abuse to which it has been subjected, is not a mere
word; it expresses a reality: it sums up in itself a number
of characters. This is sufficient for us, and allows us to
eliminate one hypothesis: that the decay of the feelings is
necessarily dependent on intellectual decay.</p>

<p class='c017'>To say truth, the question stated above: Is the retrogression
of the feelings a primary, and that of ideas a
secondary fact? or the contrary? is, under this form,
somewhat factitious. It is only by analytical artifice that
we separate thought and feeling, which, by their nature, are
closely connected. The law of retrogression is generally
valid in biology, and probably also in psychology; it does
not act on isolated points, it gradually surrounds and saps
the whole building, no matter on what side it begins. It
is clear that all weakening of the intellect, such as that
produced by old age and disease (difficulty in understanding
general ideas, loss of certain groups of recollections, etc.),
involves the disappearance of the corresponding affective
states: one of the observations already quoted (Case B.) is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>an instance in point. But we must not thence conclude
that the retrogression of the affective life <em>is</em>, <em>by right</em>,
always subordinated to that of knowledge. Most cases of
degenerescence prove the contrary; it is essentially an
organic decadence, a state of physiological poverty, showing
itself first of all by alterations in the range of the emotions,
tendencies, actions, and movements. The intellect, for its
part, is better able to stand the shock, and sometimes
remains uninjured. More than this, the adherents of this
doctrine have shown that the degenerate are sometimes
endowed with brilliant intellectual faculties; while some
have even maintained that degenerescence is a necessary
condition of high mental originality (“genius a neurosis,”
etc).</p>

<p class='c017'>Apart from all exaggeration, the mass of facts permits us
to make the induction that decadence is primarily (not exclusively)
that of the affective tendencies and manifestations,
since it is on them that degenerescence (taking the word in
its least vague sense) first and principally acts.</p>

</div>

<p class='c020'><i>The place of the feelings in psychic life—They come first—Physiological
proofs—Psychological proofs.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>Through the multiple aspects of our subject and the
diversity of questions we have dealt with, the fundamental
idea of this book has been to show that the foundation of
the affective life is appetite or its contrary—that is to say,
movement or arrest of movement; that at its root it is an
impulse, a tendency, an act in the nascent or complete
state, independent of intelligence, which has nothing to do
with it and may not even be present. It is unnecessary to
inflict upon the reader any new variations on a theme so
often repeated. I only desire, in conclusion, to add some
remarks on the place of the feelings in the total psychic
life, and to show that that place is the <em>first</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>This statement must be made precise. To compare
“sensibility” and “intelligence,” as some authors have
done, to see which of these two “faculties” is inferior to
the other, is an artificial and unreasonable task, since there
is no common measure of the two, and there can be no
solution of the question which is not arbitrary. But we
may proceed objectively, and ask if the one is not primary
and the other secondary, if the one is not grafted on the
other, and in that case which is the stock and which the
graft. If the feelings appear first it is clear that they cannot
be derived, and are not a mode or function of knowledge,
since they exist by themselves and are irreducible.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus stated the question is simple and the reply evident.</p>

<p class='c017'>The physiological evidence in favour of the priority of
the feelings need only be briefly recalled; it all centres in
one point: organic vegetative life always and everywhere
appears before animal life; physiologists constantly repeat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>that the animal is grafted on the vegetable which precedes
him. Now organic life is directly expressed by the needs
and appetites, which are the stuff of the affective life;
animal life by the sensations, the stuff of the intellectual
life. The primordial part played by organic sensibility has
been shown in the Introduction. We may remember also
the myriads of animals which are only bundles of needs,
their psychology consisting in the search for food, in defence,
and in propagation; their senses (often reduced to touch
alone) are only tools, coarse instruments, teleological
weapons in the service of their needs; but closed in as
they may be from the external world, appetite in them is
not less intense. Even in man is not fœtal life, and that of
the first months after birth, much the same, almost wholly
made up of satisfied or unsatisfied needs, and consequently
of pleasures and pains? From the purely physiological
point of view, knowledge appears not as a mistress but as a
servant.</p>

<p class='c017'>The psychological evidence is not difficult to supply, and
has indeed already been presented by Schopenhauer in so
brilliant and complete a manner that it would be a bold
task to present it afresh. The chapter entitled “The
Primacy of Will in Self-Consciousness”<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c010'><sup>[258]</sup></a> is a long argument
in favour of the priority of impulse over knowledge. We
need not be duped by the equivocal use of the word “will,”
since for Schopenhauer “to will is to desire, to aspire, to
flee, to hope, to fear, to love, to hate; in a word, all that
directly constitutes our good and our ill, our pleasure and
our pain.” Nor need we occupy ourselves with his metaphysics
nor his antiquated physiology, nor his personal
hatred of intelligence, which he treats as an enemy and
usurper, “because all the philosophers up to to-day have
made it the intimate primitive essence of their so-called
soul;” and having made these eliminations we may find
many of his pages full of penetrating and consummate
psychology. I recall his chief arguments.</p>

<p class='c017'>Will (in the sense above indicated) is universal. The
basis of consciousness in every animal is desire. This
fundamental fact is translated into the impulse to preserve
life and well-being, and to propagate. This foundation is
common to the polypus and to man. The differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>among animals are due to a difference in knowledge; as
we descend in the series intelligence becomes weaker
and more imperfect; there is no similar degradation in will
(or desire); the smallest insect wills what it wills as fully
as man; will is everywhere equal to itself. Relatively to
intelligence it is the robust blind man carrying on his
shoulders the paralytic who sees clearly.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is fundamental. The will to live, with the horror of
death which results from it, is a fact anterior to all intelligence
and independent of it. In it is the basis of identity
and of character; “the man is hidden in the heart and not
in the head.” It is the source and the bond of all stable
associations, religious, political, or professional. It makes
the strength of party spirit, of sects, and of factions. Compare
the fragility of friendships founded on similarity of
intelligence with those that spring from the heart. Thus
religions have had every reason to promise eternal recompense
to man’s moral qualities, and not to the gifts of the
mind.</p>

<p class='c017'>Its power is sovereign. It is not reason which uses
passion, it is passion which uses reason to reach its ends.
Under the influence of intense desire, the intellect sometimes
rises to a degree of vigour of which none would
believe it capable. Desire, love, fear render the most
obtuse understanding lucid. And besides, if will and intelligence
were identical in nature, their development would
proceed side by side, whereas nothing is more frequent
than a great intellect united to an inferior character, and
“we sometimes find violent desires, impassioned and impetuous
impulses, joined to a feeble intellect, that is to say
a small brain badly enclosed in a thick skull.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Memory, which is commonly considered a purely intellectual
phenomenon, often depends—as we have seen—on
the state of the feelings. This had not escaped
Schopenhauer. “Even a weak memory sometimes retains
perfectly what concerns the passion dominant at the
moment; the lover never forgets a favourable opportunity,
the ambitious nothing that serves their projects; the miser
never forgets his losses, nor the proud man a wound to his
honour; the vain remember every word of praise and every
distinction they receive.... That is what might be called
the heart’s memory, more intimate than the mind’s.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>How is it that facts of common observation, so clear
and so numerous, requiring for their discovery neither experiment
nor special research, nor even long reflection, have been
so generally misunderstood; and that the contrary opinion
has always predominated, reducing the manifestations of
feeling to “qualities of sensation,” to “confused intelligence,”
and other oft-repeated formulas? The only reason
I can find is that during centuries this subject has been
treated philosophically, not psychologically, and the method
of philosophy is necessarily intellectualist. Only the adult
and complex forms of the affective life were considered,
without regard to their evolution, which alone brings us to
their origin. The parts played by movements as psychological
factors, and by unconscious activity, were forgotten
or misunderstood. Pleasures and pains in their manifold
forms were regarded as the essential phenomena in place of
the hidden springs which give rise to them.</p>

<p class='c019'>To sum up, the psychology of the emotions has its point
of departure in those complex feelings which daily life brings
beneath our eyes every moment. Their complexity is the
work of our intellectual nature, which associates and dissociates,
mixing and combining perceptions, images, ideas,
each of which, in so far as it relates to the individual or
social conditions of existence, to the physiological needs, to
the offensive and defensive instinct of conservation, to the
social, moral, religious, æsthetic, and scientific tendencies,
produces in the organism variable effects which, translated
into consciousness, impart an affective tone to intellectual
states. Analysis shows that these complex forms are reducible
to a few simple emotions. The simple emotion
itself is a complexus made up of impulses, that is of motor
elements, and agreeable, painful, or mixed states of consciousness;
these two factors form a whole apparently indissoluble.
Finally, the fundamental motor or dynamic
element manifests itself under two forms: conscious impulses
or desires, unconscious impulses or appetites; there
is identity of nature, the first possessing consciousness in
addition. Hence for the desires (the psychological form),
thanks to consciousness, there is the possibility of manifold
adaptations and indefinite plasticity. Hence for the appetites
(the physiological form) there is stability, fixity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>automatism, the absence of invention, and of that state of
indecision arising simultaneously with consciousness.</p>

<p class='c017'>If we include all the primitive conscious impulses beneath
the name of <em>desire</em> (or its opposite, <em>aversion</em>), we find two
apparently contradictory theses concerning its origin. According
to one, desire is a primitive phenomenon, anterior
on the one hand to all knowledge, and on the other to all
experience of pleasure or pain. According to the other,
desire is a secondary phenomenon, the anticipation of a
known pleasure to seek for, a known pain to avoid; the
latter counts most partisans, and is also condensed into
well-known axiomatic sayings and formulas: “We cannot
desire what we do not know,” “We can only desire what
seems to be for our advantage,” “Desire is founded on a
proved pleasure.” Both theses are true, each for a separate
moment, and the first alone relates to the question of
origin.</p>

<p class='c017'>At the first moment desire is anterior to all experience, to
every consideration of pleasure or of pain; it acts as a blind
force; it is a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vis a tergo</i></span>, a propulsion only explicable by the
physical and mental organism. It must necessarily act at
once without knowing whither it goes, else it would act too
late or not at all.</p>

<p class='c017'>At the second moment, it is guided by experience and
rests on proved pleasure or pain, seeking one and avoiding
the other. It is to this moment that the sayings above
quoted apply. That is the final form, and it embraces the
immense majority of cases. Even in the adult, however,
we have noted examples of vague desire, without object or
determined aim.</p>

<p class='c017'>Blind impulse, when it reaches its end, finds its satisfaction
there, and seeks it anew because it is pleasant. But the
pleasant and the unpleasant are relative qualities, varying
in individuals, and at different moments in the same individual.
If the physical and mental organisation changes,
the impulses, the position of pleasure and pain change
also; pathology furnishes us with unquestionable proof.</p>

<p class='c017'>Impulse, therefore, is the primordial fact in the life of the
feelings, and I cannot better conclude than by borrowing
from Spinoza a passage which sums up the whole spirit of
this book: “Appetite is the very essence of man, from
which necessarily flow all those things which seem to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>preserve him.... Between appetite and desire there is
no difference, save that desire is self-conscious appetite.
It follows from all this that we desire and follow after
nothing because we deem it to be good, but on the
contrary deem that to be good which we desire and follow
after.”<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c010'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. It may be doubted whether all the English writers here mentioned
can be strictly classed with the physiological school as understood by
M. Ribot. With regard to Mr. Spencer, for instance, this is indicated
by a brief summary of his own position in a private letter to the
Rev. Angus Mackay, who had presented a statement of the “confused
intelligence” theory, “which I conceive to be a part of the truth,”
wrote Mr. Spencer, adding that “joined with the dimly aroused
association of ideas derived from the experiences of the individual, I
hold that the body of the emotion consists more largely of the
inherited associations of experiences and still more vague states of
consciousness which result from excitement of them.” It is clear
that the evolutionary view does not necessarily fall wholly into the
“physiological” group.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. It is probable that the dates assigned for the first appearance of
emotional manifestations by Darwin, Preyer, Perez, etc., are mostly
too late, as they were not the outcome of continuous observation. Mrs.
Kathleen Carter Moore, in her recent elaborate monograph dealing with
the early mental development of her own baby, whom she regards as an
average infant, observed the tear secretion first on the tenth day, though
it was not fully established until the sixteenth week; a smile when comfortable
was seen on the sixth day; the child smiled several times
consecutively at his father on the seventh day with movements of
excitement, and by the twentieth day smiling at persons had become
more frequent and more intelligent. (See K. C. Moore, “The
Mental Development of a Child,” Monograph Supplement to the
<cite>Psychological Review</cite>, 1896).—ED.</p>

Nothing can be vaguer and more uncertain than the terminology of our

Strong, <cite>Psychological Review</cite>, 1895, vol. ii. p. 332) reports the following
extraordinary case of natural analgesia: Man who died at age of fifty-six,
cheerful and corpulent, weighing some 250 pounds; intelligent,
and vigorous both in body and mind, with a considerable reputation as
a lawyer and politician. Having a finger wounded in a crush during a
political campaign, he removed it himself by biting it off and spitting it
on to the ground. He had an ulcer on the toe which resisted treatment
for three years without ever causing him the slightest pain. He also had
an abscess in the hand which spread to the fore-arm and arm, causing
enormous swelling and endangering his life; the lancet was used without
precaution, and throughout he felt no pain. It was the same with an
operation for cataract on both eyes; he remained motionless as a statue.
It was only during his last illness that he complained of some pain, but
that quickly passed away, and he had returned to his state of natural
insensibility before he died.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. Hahnemann distinguished 73 kinds of physical pain, Georget 38,
Renaudin 12, etc. I give these numbers as curiosities. More recently
Goldscheider (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ueber den Schmerz</cite></span>) establishes three stages in physical
pain: (1) true, real (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>echte</i></span>) pains; they depend on the nerves of special
sensibility, and are caused by mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimulations,
by inflammation and poisons; (2) indirect pains, pseudo-pains,
which consist especially in a state of discomfort (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Schmerzweh</i></span>); in the
case of the head, stomach, etc., they may be as oppressive and cause
as much torture as “real” pains; (3) psychic or ideal (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>ideel</i></span>) pains,
which are a hyperæsthesia of the sensitive activity; they are met with in
neuroses (neurasthenia, hysteria, hypochondria), in hallucinations, the
hypnotic state, etc. This classification is perhaps acceptable in physiology.
For psychology, every pain, in virtue of being a fact of consciousness,
is “true” and “real.”</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. This thesis has been principally maintained in America by H.
Nichols (<cite>Philosophical Review</cite>, July 1892), and in France by Bourdon
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Revue Philosophique</cite></span>, September 1893). The former applies it to
pleasure and pain, considering them fundamental sensations as
distinct from one another as they are from other sensations. This
article contains some ingenious considerations on the part played by
the association of ideas. Bourdon applies it only to pleasure, and
considers pain irreducible. He regards pleasure as a special sensation,
not a common one or an attribute of all sensations; it is “of the same
nature as the special sensation of tickling.” By adducing the pleasure
of tickling (in which he follows Descartes and others), Bourdon partially
escapes the criticism already advanced. It must be remarked, however,
that tickling is itself a sensation of which the organic conditions are
very vaguely determined. Besides the cutaneous impression, there are
certainly also diffused reflex actions which connect it quite as much
with internal sensibility as with the sense of touch.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f34'>
<p class='c017'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. Dr. G. Dumas has made experiments on the condition of the
circulation in states of joy and of sadness. He has attempted an
experimental verification of Lange’s theory by showing that a definite
condition of the circulation always accompanies various agreeable and
painful emotions, and that “joy and sadness may thus be regarded as
the mental reverberation of these circulatory conditions and their
organic consequences.” See <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Recherches expérimentales sur la Joie

<p class='c017'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. This also seems to be the view adopted by Rutgers Marshall (<i>op.
cit.</i>). In the first place, he always considers “pleasure-pains” as connected
states, pleasure being experienced “whenever the physical
activity coincident with the psychic state to which the pleasure is
attached involves the use of surplus stored force—the resolution of
surplus potential into actual energy; or, in other words, whenever the
energy involved in the reaction to a stimulus is greater in amount than
the energy which the stimulus habitually calls forth.”—P. 204.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. I give an instance of a similar character, narrated by a historian,
from Arabic sources. "The Emir Mohammed (at Granada, in 1408),
finding himself dying, and anxious to secure the throne to his son,
sent orders for his brother Yussuf, whom he was keeping in captivity at
Salobreña, to be put to death. The alcalde, when he received this
order, was playing at chess with his prisoner, whose gentleness had
gained the heart of his gaolers. On reading the fatal despatch he was
troubled, and did not dare to communicate its contents to the prince.
But Yussuf guessed from his confusion what was the matter, and said
to the alcalde, ‘Is it my head that is asked of thee?’ The latter, for
all answer, handed to him his brother’s letter. Yussuf asked only for
a few hours’ delay, in order to take leave of his wife; but the messenger
of death declared that the execution must take place at once, the hour
of his return being fixed beforehand. ‘Well,’ replied Yussuf, ‘let
us at least finish the game.’ But the alcalde was so distressed that he
advanced his pawns at random, and Yussuf was obliged to inform him
of his mistakes. However, the game was never finished. Some
knights, riding from Granada at full gallop, saluted Yussuf as Emir,
and announced to him the death of his brother. When thus passing
from the scaffold to the throne the Mussulman prince remained master
of himself, as he had been in the face of death. Still doubting his
good fortune, he set out for Granada, where he was received by the
people with cries of joy." (Rosseuw St.-Hilaire, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Histoire d’Espagne</cite></span>,
vol. v., p. 227.) Analogous traits are recorded of various historic
personages.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c017'><a href='#r59'>59</a>. For the historical summary, see Bouillier, <i>op. cit.</i>, chap. xii.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c017'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. "The first cry of the new-born infant was formerly considered anything
rather than a reflex action. It is, however, very probable that
this first vocal manifestation, accompanying an expiration, is a reflex
pure and simple. Kant wrote (without, indeed, having himself
observed new-born children or animals): ‘The cry uttered by the child
just after birth has not the intonation of fear, but that of irritation or
anger. It is not because it is suffering, but because something displeases
it. No doubt it would like to move and feels its impotence, as
it might feel a chain restricting its liberty. What could have been the
object of Nature in making the infant born into the world utter cries
which are in the highest degree dangerous? Yet no animal save man
announces its existence, at the time of birth, by similar cries.’</p>

<p class='c017'>"This remarkable conception has been much commented on, and
widely adopted. At the present time many people still think that the
crying of new-born infants has considerable psychic significance. But all
comments of this kind are met by the objection that a totally anencephalous
infant cries at birth, and that many healthy infants do not cry,
but sneeze, on their entry into the world, as noted by Darwin....</p>

<p class='c017'>"The reflexes of pains which, in later life, show themselves in the
acutest manner, are those best developed in early life. Gunzmer’s observations
on about sixty infants showed him that, during the first few days,
they are almost insensible, and during the first week, very slightly
sensitive, to the pricking of a needle.</p>

<p class='c017'>“New-born infants have been, in the course of their first day,
pricked with fine needles, on the nose, the upper lip, and the hand,
deeply enough to draw a drop of blood; yet the child manifested no
symptom of consciousness, and did not start once.”—Preyer, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Seele des

surprise, fear, and repulsion (the last-named as a substitute for anger)
has been observed. Dr. Sollier, in an article in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Revue Philosophique</cite></span>
(March, 1894), has reported some experiments made on subjects in a
profoundly hypnotic state, in whom the peripheral and visceral sensibility
had been abolished by suggestion. He comes to the same conclusions

<p class='c017'><a href='#r76'>76</a>. Gurney, in a criticism of James’s hypothesis (<cite>Mind</cite>, ix. 425), says:
“There is plenty of music from which I have received as much emotion
in silent representation” [<i>i.e.</i>, by purely internal audition, or merely
reading the notes] “as when presented by the finest orchestra; but it
is with the latter condition that I almost exclusively associate the
cutaneous tingling and hair-stirring.” Professor James has, in my
opinion, answered this objection (<cite>Psychology</cite>, ii. pp. 469, 470), which
I should be inclined to refer to the problem of the “revivability of
impressions,” to be examined later on.</p>

will bear comparison with anything that has been produced in recent
years. It will be difficult, indeed, to find any treatment of the emotions
much superior to it in originality, thoroughness, and suggestiveness.
The position maintained is similar to that now held by Professor James,
but Descartes does not content himself with defending in a general way
the assertion that emotion is caused by physical change. After coming
to the conclusion that there are six passions from which all the others
are derived, he attempts to show that a special set of organic effects is
concerned in the production of each of these primary states.”—D. Irons

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f79'>
<p class='c017'><a href='#r79'>79</a>. “When any great passion causes all the physical and moral
troubles which it will cause, what I conceive to happen is that a
physical impression made on the sense of sight or of hearing is propagated
along a physical path to the brain, and arouses a physical
commotion in its molecules; that from this centre of commotion the
liberated energy is propagated by physical paths to other parts of the
brain; and that it is finally discharged outwardly through proper
physical paths, either in movements or in modifications of secretion
and nutrition. The passion that is felt is the subjective side of the
cerebral commotion—its <em>motion</em> out from the physical basis, as it were
(<em>e-motion</em>), into consciousness.”—<cite>Pathology of Mind</cite>, 1879, p. 222.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r80'>80</a>. In his lectures on Hysteria (Vol. i., Lecture 21), Pitres incidentally
inquires into the existence of encephalic centres of the affective states,
and concludes that “the molecular changes corresponding to the
activity of the cellular elements shaken by the passions, radiate in every
direction, stimulate or depress the excitability of adjacent elements,
rebound on the motor and sensitive centres, and on the originatory
nuclei of the visceral nerves, and finally determine the state of emotion,
<i>i.e.</i>, the psycho-physiological state which is the special expression of the
reaction of the nervous centres to psychic excitations.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f86'>
<p class='c017'><a href='#r86'>86</a>. Duchenne has the following curious passage:—"The Creator, not
being obliged to study mechanical requirements, was able, according
to His wisdom or (if I may be pardoned for using this form of expression)
by a Divine fantasy, to put in action this or that muscle—a
single one, or several at once, when it was His will that the signs of
the passions, even the most evanescent, should be temporarily inscribed
on the human countenance. This physiognomic language once created,
it was sufficient, in order to render it universal and immutable, to give
to every human being the instinctive faculty of always expressing his
feelings by the contraction of the same muscles." Thus, for this writer,
the question remains within the region of first causes. He has ascertained

an arrangement by means of which he convinced himself that
some arithmetical operations can be carried out by the help of
olfactory images, as is done by means of visual and auditory
representations. He trains himself to regard two whiffs of peppermint as
equivalent to one of camphor, and three of peppermint with one of
carbolic acid; he performs small additions, and, later on, operates
with images only (visual and auditory representations being excluded).

<p class='c017'><a href='#r104'>104</a>. A characteristic peculiar to emotional affective revivability is the
slowness with which it develops and the time required. While the
visual or auditory image may be called up instantaneously and at command,
the emotional representation arises slowly. This is because it
passes through two stages. The first (intellectual) consists in the
evocation of conditions and circumstances—a toothache, a burn, a
passion. Many do not get beyond this stage, and the concomitant
emotional tone, accordingly, is faint, or even <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span>. The second or
emotional stage adds to this the rise of states of excitement and exultation,
or of dejection and lowered vitality. The latter requires organic
conditions, a difference in the organism, an excitement of the motor,
vascular, respiratory, secretory, and other centres.</p>

found not only in the case of vision, but especially in that of smell.

<p class='c017'><a href='#r109'>109</a>. This chapter was first published in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Revue Philosophique</cite></span> for
October 1894. It called forth some new communications, two only of
which have been added to the original text. The affirmation of a type
of affective memory has, as I expected, provoked both criticism and
denial. My principal opponent, Prof. Titchener, has published on
this subject a somewhat extensive article in the <cite>Philosophical Review</cite>
(November 1895), in which he reproaches me with not having cited a
single case of pure emotional memory—i.e., memory from which all
sensory and ideational elements are absent, and where there is a revival
of feeling <em>as such</em>. An example of this kind, which should be quite
conclusive, seems to me almost impossible to produce. A pleasure, a
pain, an emotion, are always associated with a sensation, a representation,
or an act; revival necessarily bringing back the intellectual state
which forms part of the complexus and supports it. But the real
question is elsewhere: Is revival, in certain persons at least, a dry
record, or a <em>felt</em> state? In this last case—and it does occur—there is
the recollection of the emotional state as such.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is another objection: Can it be said that an emotion is the
reproduction of an antecedent emotion, and not a new emotion? The
reproduction of an emotion can itself be nothing other than an emotion,
but it bears the marks of repetition. Without returning to what has
been said above, I remark that those contemporary psychologists, who
study with admirable patience the mechanism of memory, neglect that
of its most general conditions. Now the chief of these is that every
recollection must be a <em>reversion</em>, by virtue of which, the past once more
becoming a present, we live at present in the past. The recollection
of an emotion as such does not escape the action of this law; it must
become actual once more—must <em>be</em> a real emotion, whether acute or
obtuse.</p>

<p class='c017'>Taking account of the criticisms, and of the new material supplied to
me, I may once again sum up my inquiry thus—</p>

<p class='c017'>1. The emotional memory is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span> in the majority of people.</p>

<p class='c017'>2. In others there is a half intellectual, half emotional memory, <i>i.e.</i>,
the emotional elements are only revived partially and with difficulty, by
the help of the intellectual states associated with them.</p>

<p class='c017'>3. Others, and these the least numerous, have a true—<i>i.e.</i>, complete—emotional
memory; the intellectual element being only a means
of revival which is rapidly effaced.</p>

of the feelings during the last half of this century, Ladd (<cite>Psychology,
Descriptive and Explanatory</cite>, pp. 163, 164) mentions: (1) the theory
of evolution, because the affective phenomena are fundamental and
permanent, and men differ from one another far less in their appetites,
emotions, and passions than in their ideas and thoughts; and because
this doctrine affirms that, underlying the highest forms of feeling, there
is always some instinctive tendency; and (2) the literary and artistic
movement which began with J. J. Rousseau, and asserts itself more
and more in the Wagnerian music and the modern novel, and which
should invite psychologists to attempt its analysis. It would be well to
add the contemporary sociological studies which have shown the important
part played by emotional elements, simple or complex, deliberately
eliminated by the economists from their theories of social
organisation.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r125'>125</a>. The discussion is to be found in his <cite>Civilisation in England</cite>

sentence quoted by him from Cuvier, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le bien qu’on fait aux hommes,
quelque grand qu’il soit, est toujours passager; les vérités qu’on leur

<div class='footnote' id='f129'>
<p class='c017'><a href='#r129'>129</a>. I must here repeat Briquet’s remark on this point: “However
strange these appetites may appear, their origin can frequently be
discovered. Thus a young woman, who would greedily devour the
embers of her foot-warmer, told me that she had, from the beginning,
been fond of the crust of bread; from this she came to like the crust of
toasted bread, then charred bread, and so gradually acquired the taste
for small pieces of charcoal. I am inclined to think that, were we to
inquire into the origin of many of these strange tastes, we should find
it as simple as the above.” Pierre Janet (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>État mental des hystériques</cite></span>,
ii. p. 71) transcribes this passage, and adds, “I have often followed
this advice and been in a position to appreciate its value.” This
psychological inquiry is very ingenious, but only removes the difficulty
a stage further back. It shows us through what series of associations the
final result is attained; but association alone is not sufficient to arrive
at this result, still less to render it permanent. It is only the external
mechanism which explains, at the utmost, why the deviation should
have taken this particular direction. Many persons are fond of crust,
even of burnt crust, who will never come to have the slightest appetite
for charcoal. Many have eaten charcoal out of curiosity, or by
accident, but without acquiring a taste for it. It is some deeper and
more powerful cause than association which lies at the root of these
feelings and renders them active.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r134'>134</a>. Since the above was written the same conclusion has been reached
by Professor Stanley Hall in a report founded on a statistical inquiry
into the fears (some 6500 in number) of 1700 children and young
persons. He concludes that “we must assume the capacity to fear
or to anticipate pain, and to associate it with certain objects and experiences,
as an inherited <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Anlage</cite></span>, often of a far higher antiquity than
we are wont to appeal to in psychology.” He considers that such
fears are analogous to rudimentary physical organs, though they still
retain a certain use. (“A Study of Fears,” <cite>American Journal of

<p class='c017'><a href='#r144'>144</a>. The psychology of imitation does not form part of our subject.
Baldwin has made an excellent study of it (<cite>Mental Development in
the Child and Race</cite>, pp. 263-366). He defines it as "a sensori-motor
reaction, which finds its differentia in the single fact
that it imitates; that is, its peculiarity is found in the locus of its
muscular discharge. It is what I have called a ‘circular activity’
on the bodily side,—brain-state due to stimulating conditions, muscular
reaction which reproduces or retains the stimulating conditions,—same
brain-state again, due to same stimulating conditions, and so on."
Imitation appears early in the child, at fifteen weeks (Preyer) or four
months (Darwin). Are we to consider it as an instinct? Popular
opinion is inclined to do so, as are also several psychologists—Stricker,
James, and others. The contrary is maintained by Preyer, Bain,
Sully, and Baldwin—a view I am myself inclined to take. Imitation
does not present the true characteristics of an instinct; it is not
adapted at the first attempt; it gropes its way, it is tentative, it
fails again after success, it retrogrades, or progresses but slowly.
It is an ideo-motor reflex; it takes its place above instinct (a blind and
innate tendency inferior to the voluntary activity for which it prepares
the way), because it is the first attempt at convergence towards an end.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r150'>150</a>. The pathology of tender emotion does not offer sufficient interest
to detain us. The altruistic tendency may be totally wanting in certain
hypochondriac and demented patients, who, entrenched in an impenetrable
egoism, have undergone a real “moral ossification.”
Tenderness may become <em>sentimentality</em> towards persons, animals
(zoophily), and things (nostalgia), etc. Morel (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Études cliniques</cite></span>, vol.
ii. sec. 4) quotes the case of a man of high intellectual capacity, in
whom the most futile and ridiculous causes excited absurd <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>accès de
sensibilité</i></span>. “The loss of domestic animals which he had reared
threw him into a state of bewilderment and convulsions of tears, as if
it had been the death of his best friends. I saw him one day almost
delirious with grief at the death of one of the numerous frogs which he
kept in his garden.” This morbid emotivity, coinciding with congenital
or acquired weakness, and with convalescence or other
adynamic states, throws into relief, by its exaggerated character,
that state of relaxation which is, as we have seen, one of the principal
marks of the tender emotion.</p>

Delbœuf: “That girl and that young man, in being attracted to one

But it may be taken as certain that this will is not unknown either to
the spermatozoid or the ovule; both know what they want, and seek it.
To this end they give their orders to their respective brains through the
medium of the heart, and the brain obeys without knowing why.
Sometimes it imagines that it has been convinced by reason and explains
its own choice to itself. At bottom it has been but an <em>unconscious</em>
instrument in the hand of an imperceptible workman who knew both
what he wanted and what he was doing.” (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Revue philosophique</cite></span>,

<p class='c017'><a href='#r178'>178</a>. “The Australians attribute the death of their friends to spells cast
by some neighbouring tribe; for this reason they consider it a sacred
obligation to avenge the death of a relative by killing a member of the
tribe in question. A native having lost one of his wives, announced
his intention of going to kill a woman belonging to a distant tribe.
The magistrate told him that if he committed this act, he would be
confined in prison for the rest of his life. He therefore did not start on
his journey; but, month by month, he wasted away: remorse preyed on
his mind, he could neither sleep nor eat; the ghost of his wife haunted
him, reproaching him with his negligence. One day he disappeared;
a year later he came back, having accomplished his duty” (Guyau,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Esquisse d’une Morale</cite></span>, etc., p. 109). Here we have an example of
instinctive morality and rational immorality. It should be noted

<p class='c017'><a href='#r180'>180</a>. About 1820, during the time of scarcity consequent on Tshaka’s
wars, certain of the Natal tribes (the natives say, at the suggestion of a
chief named Umdava) adopted the practice of cannibalism. It was
abandoned when food again became plentiful, and has always been
regarded with great horror; those individuals who had acquired such
a taste for human flesh as to prefer it to other food, fled into the recesses
of the Drakensberg and Maluti mountains. Moshesh, the great Basuto
chief, directed his efforts for years to the extirpation of the practice,
though unwilling to do so, as his advisers desired, by means of a
summary massacre of the offenders. The <em>Amazimu</em> (<em>Modimo</em>) are now
a myth to both Zulus and Basutos; indeed the word, as now used, is
frequently synonymous with “ogre.” It is to be noted that Moshesh
was not in any way acting under European influence, in fact the last of
the cannibals had disappeared long before the country came under
British rule, and though the memory of their atrocities was still fresh
when the French missionaries arrived in 1833, the chief had already
been proceeding against them for some time. See Casalis, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Bassoutos</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r203'>203</a>. This theory of play, however, appears, from recent researches, to
be of English origin, and due to Home (1696-1782), so that, when
taken up again by Herbert Spencer (<cite>Principles of Psychology</cite>, vol. ii.,

<div class='footnote' id='f204'>
<p class='c017'><a href='#r204'>204</a>. In a recent book, very rich in observations on the play of animals
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Die Spiele der Thiere</cite></span>, 1896, the only existing monograph on the
subject), Groos substitutes for the thesis of a superabundance of energy
that of a primary instinct, of which play, in all its forms, is the expression.
I cannot see that the two theses exclude one another. Some
base their argument on external manifestations. Groos connects them
with an instinct—<i>i.e.</i>, a motor disposition <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sui generis</i></span>. I am inclined
to take Groos’s view, the more so as the fundamental idea of the present
work is that of finally reducing the affective life to the sum of a set
of tendencies fixed in the organisation.</p>

<p class='c017'>For the rest, the psychology of play is still awaiting treatment in its
totality. The word, in fact, denotes several entirely different psychical
manifestations. In its first stage, it is unconscious in its origin, spontaneous,
an expenditure for the mere pleasure of spending; but, however
disinterested in its source and its aim, it is useful; in children,
play is often a form of imitation, often a form of experimentation, an
attempt at easy and unconstrained exploration of beings and things. In
the second stage, it has become reflective; pleasure is sought for its
own sake, and with full consciousness of the reason; it is a complex
state formed by the fusion of variable elements. In a special study,
which, however, is merely tentative (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Die Reize des Spieles</cite></span>, 1883),
Lazarus adopts the following classification: (<i>a</i>) games connected with
physical activity, (<i>b</i>) the attraction of all kinds of spectacles, (<i>c</i>) intellectual
games, (<i>d</i>) games of chance. This last item alone might well
prove a tempting one to a psychologist. It has a quasi-passive, somewhat
blunted form, being what Pascal called a diversion (that which
turns aside, distracts), a way of pretending to work, or filling up the
blanks of existence, of “killing time.” It has an active form, the
gambling passion, whose tragedy is as old as humanity, and which is
made up of attraction towards the unknown and the hazardous, of
daring, of emulation, of the desire of victory, the love of gain, and
the fascination of acquiring wealth wholesale, instantaneously, without
effort. These and other elements show that, in play as in love, it
is complexity which produces intensity. The absence of any complete
first-hand studies on this subject shows once more the scarcity of
monographs relating to the psychology of the feelings.</p>

definite one. Moreover, are not all emotions connected with life?</p>

of the individual and the species by an extremely bold and
problematical hypothesis resting on heredity. If we experience
different feelings before a stormy sea, or a calm, blue lake, covered with
boats, or a vast plain, or snow-covered mountains, “it is because our
feelings are those of primitive man, when he lived really in the midst
of nature and had to wrest his daily bread from it. Through countless
generations our ancestors, on finishing their daily task, in the evening
have thought with satisfaction of the work accomplished; it was in
this frame of mind that they looked on the approach of evening and
the sunset. Why does a landscape representing it produce on us an
impression of repose and peace? We have no other answer than this:
for countless generations past the evening sky has been associated with
the consciousness of work finished and a feeling of rest and satisfaction.”
Apart from its extreme flimsiness, this hypothesis would not be
applicable to all the arts.</p>

beautiful districts as “fertile,” “rich in wheat,” “horse-feeding,” etc.
He heard a peasant in the neighbourhood of Hyères praising the magnificence
of a cultivated plain covered with vegetables, while showing
the greatest contempt for a picturesque bit of woodland. An American
visiting England said, “Your country, sir, is very beautiful. In many
parts you may go for miles together and never see a tree except in a
hedge.” Any one who has had much to do with the peasantry could
quote hundreds of remarks similar to the above.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r216'>216</a>. I shall be pardoned for introducing the following passage from
Théophile Gautier; it is, under its humorous form, so just from a
psychological point of view: “Ideals torment even the coarsest natures.
The savage, when he tattooes himself, or smears his body with red and
blue, or sticks a fish-bone through his nose, is only obeying a confused
sense of the beautiful. He is seeking for something beyond what exists;
he is trying to perfect his type, guided by a dim notion of art. The
taste for ornament distinguishes man from brute more clearly than any
other peculiarity. No dog ever thought of putting rings into his ears;
and the stupid Papuans, who eat clay and earthworms, make themselves
earrings of shells and coloured berries.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f221'>
<p class='c017'><a href='#r221'>221</a>. Æsthetic activity is that form of play which uses images as its
creative materials. It is generally admitted that visual and auditory
perceptions or representations are the only ones which provoke
æsthetic emotion; yet Guyau (followed perhaps by others) has maintained
that we must attribute this power to all external sensations,
without exception (<i>Problèmes de l’esthétique contemporaine</i>, chap. vi.),
heat, cold, contacts, tastes, and odours; but the facts he enumerates are
in most cases referable to association, especially where odours are concerned.
The so-called lower sensations do not act directly, they only
revive the representations of sight and hearing. A delicious coolness,
a soft contact, an intoxicating odour produce an agreeable state—<i>i.e.</i>,
a physical pleasure, and nothing more, if there is no association. Besides,
without entering into an idle and hair-splitting discussion, it is
sufficient to observe that, as a matter of fact, there exists no art, in the
æsthetic sense, based on any other sensations than those of sight and
hearing, unless we are to look on perfumery and cookery as such.</p>

<p class='c017'>Why is this privilege exclusively confined to two species of
sensations? Various reasons have been given: because they
are more remote from the life-serving functions with which the
sensations of touch, taste, and smell are closely connected (II.
Spencer); or because their pleasures and pains have, in general,
a moderate character, and their special nerves are rarely subjected
to a violent shock (Gurney); or, according to Grant Allen,
because the nerves of the lower senses are excited in mass, and
those of the higher by isolated fibres (? ?). It appears to me that one
of the principal reasons has been forgotten. If we refer back to the
inquiries detailed in Chap. IX. (Part I.) as to the olfactory and gustatory
images, we shall see that they have their own peculiar characters. For
visual and auditory images, revival and association are easy, whether
simultaneously, in groups, or successively, in series. For images of
smell and taste, it is quite the contrary; their revivability is feeble or
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span>, their power of association with each other <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nil</i></span>. (The tactile-motor
images form an intermediate group, but nearer to the lower senses.)
These psychological conditions render them quite unsuitable for a place
in a constructive scheme. Called up with great difficulty by the
memory, incapable of being grouped, either in simultaneities or in
series, they can supply neither an art in rest nor an art in movement.</p>

his childhood without result. It was discovered, later on, that he was
incapable of distinguishing one note from another, except at intervals
which were sometimes as much as an octave, or even more. He was
quite unconscious of harmonies and discords, or the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>timbre</i></span> of instruments.
The distinctive features of the latter were, for him, only
clearly perceived noises of different kinds—a sound of wire-work for
the piano, a scraping for the violin, a puff of air for the organ. He
was very sensitive to the rhythm of poetry. It is not known whether
anomalies of this kind originate in Corti’s organs or in the cerebral
centres.</p>

<p class='c017'><a href='#r235'>235</a>. In the following, reported by a traveller, we have an instance of
this spontaneous transition to disinterested curiosity, in the case of an
intelligent Basuto. “Twelve years ago” [the man himself is speaking]
“I went to feed my flocks. The weather was hazy. I sat down upon
a rock and asked myself sorrowful questions; yes, sorrowful, because
I was unable to answer them. Who has touched the stars with his
hands? On what pillars do they rest? I asked myself. The waters are
never weary; they know no other law than to flow without ceasing,—from
morning till night, and from night till morning; but where do
they stop? and who makes them flow thus? The clouds also come and
go, and burst in water over the earth. Whence come they? Who
sends them? The diviners certainly do not give us rain; for how could
they do it? and why do I not see them with my own eyes, when they
go up to heaven to fetch it? ... I cannot see the wind; but what
is it? Who brings it, makes it blow? ... Then I buried my face
in both my hands.”—Quoted by Vignoli, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Mito e Scienza</cite></span>, p. 63.

of coming to a conclusion). (2) Emotions arising from relations of
time (present, past, future, anticipation, hope, presentiment; feeling
of the irremediable, of opportunity, of routine, etc.). (3) Emotions
arising from relations of space (size, nearness, distance, etc.). (4)
Emotions arising from relations of coexistence and non-existence,
quantity, identity, etc. This is a much abridged catalogue; there are

<div class='footnote' id='f239'>
<p class='c017'><a href='#r239'>239</a>. Two American psychologists, without mentioning the principal
forms we have just studied, reckon among contemporary aberrations of
the intellectual feeling some tendencies which appear to me to be very
slight infirmities by comparison: (1) “A more subtle form is that distinctively
nineteenth-century disease, the love of culture, as such. When the
feeling is directed, not towards objects, but towards the state of mind
induced by the knowledge of the objects, there originates a love of
knowing for the sake of the development of the mind itself. The
knowledge is acquired because it widens and expands self. Culture of
our mental powers is made an end in itself, and knowledge of the
universe of objects is subordinated to this. The intellectual feelings
are separated from their proper place as functions of the integral life,
and are given an independent place in consciousness. Here, as in all
such cases, the attempt defeats itself. The only way to develop self is
to make it become objective; the only way to accomplish this is to
surrender the interests of the personal self. Self-culture reverses the
process and attempts to employ self-objectification or knowledge as a
mere means to the satisfaction of these personal interests. The result
is that the individual never truly gets outside of himself” (Dewey,
<cite>Psychology</cite>, pp. 305, 306). This criticism is just. We might say, more
simply, that the pursuit of intellectual emotion for its own sake borders
on scientific dilettantism—<i>i.e.</i>, a superficial disposition and a tendency
of the mind to run in every direction without going very deeply into
anything. But we cannot reckon as morbid the love of abstract and
purely speculative research; for in this the intellectual feeling remains
faithful to its nature, <i>i.e.</i> curiosity, and its mission, <i>i.e.</i> the pursuit
of truth. Besides, the speculations which in appearance are the most
useless and merely theoretical, may some day show themselves in
results susceptible of practical application. (2) Ladd, <cite>Psychology
Descriptive and Explanatory</cite>, pp. 566 <i>et seq.</i>, considers as a morbid
form of the intellectual sentiment the personification of Science, which
is so popular at the present day (in my opinion, it is rather a disease of
thought, an instance of the incurable tendency of the human mind to
realise abstractions and bow the knee before idols of its own fabrication),
and also criticises the growing love of minutiæ and the obstinate
pursuit of small facts. It must be acknowledged that this tendency
sometimes becomes a nuisance in sciences founded on observation,
experiment, or documents, and that those whose attention has been
confined to this kind of work have a natural disposition to exaggerate
its importance; but it is nevertheless necessary, and is the price paid
for all progress in science. Each individual contributes in his degree
and according to his strength; there is no architecture without
labourers.</p>

first to show it, as it is the last to be restored when the disorder passes
away; the latest and highest gain of mental evolution, it is the first to
witness by its impairment to mental dissolution.... In undoing a
mental organisation, nature begins by unravelling the finest, most
delicate, most intricately woven, and last completed threads of her
marvellously complex network. Were the moral sense as old and
firmly fixed an instinct as the instinct to walk upright, or the more
deeply planted instinct of propagation,—as many people in the presumed
interests of morality have tried to persuade themselves and
others that it is,—it would not be the first to suffer in this way when
mental degeneration begins; its categorical imperative would not take
instant flight at the first assault, but would assert its authority at a later
period of the decline; but, being the last acquired and the least fixed,
it is most likely to vary, not only ... in the pathological way of
degeneracy, but also ... in physiological ways, according to the
diversities of conditions in which it is placed.” (Maudsley, <cite>Body and

pick up new tunes; and mentions cases where the patient, seated
before a piano, could play old melodies though incapable of anything else.
A girl, aged fourteen, became demented through brain fever and had
ceased to speak, save a few words, but was still fond of music and
would play fragments of <a id='corr434.n1.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='tunes'>tunes.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_434.n1.9'><ins class='correction' title='tunes'>tunes.</ins></a></span> Two lady patients, though incoherent

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
